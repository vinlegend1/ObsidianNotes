- Spacing
    - [Graphic Design Principles Are CRUCIAL! (Here&#39;sWhy) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfkzHRM70sQ) 
    - spacing provides what function?>>>
        - enhances visual hierarchy 
        - prevents clutter
        - adds style
        - enhances proximity
    - macro white space>>>
        - large area of nothingness in design
        - modern and minimalist and luxury
    - micro white space>>>
        - smaller area of nothingness between lines of text and paragraphs of text
        - informative and serious if the balance is shifted this way
    - passive white space↔refers to space that helps with legibility and aesthetics of layout
    - active white space↔helps viewer move through your design in order and structure

    - Typography Hacks
        - Bigger Line Heights
            - 1.1-1.3x headings
            - 1.3-1.5x body text
        - Negative Letter Spacing
        - Text Alignment
            - Don't mix and match alignment between heading and body text
            - long lines of text are usually perceived by users as intimidating and overwhelming
        - Whitespace is to be regarded as an active element, not a passive background
        - Use Fewer Font Sizes
        - Use HSB and adjust a bit
        - Decide on Adjectives
        - Use the best imagery
    - there are always exceptions to rules
    - Font Pairings that are really good:
        - aileron (small body text) + anek (heading)→more modern designs
        - roboto slab (heading) + mulish (subheadings and body text)→serious designs and informative designs
        - Oswald (headings, hard hitting) + Open Sans (body text, subheadings)
    - 
    - Choosing fonts, consider the following>>>
        - the audience
        - the function or purpose
        - check legibility or how easily read the font is
        - font pairing
    - 
    - Types of fonts>>>
        - serif→tradition, history, reliability, safety
        - san serif→modern and clean
        - script fonts→grace and elegance
        - monospace fonts→programming 
    - 
    - Golden General Rules
        - main body text→10-12 pts or 15-25 px
        - line spacing>>>
            - also known as leading
            - 120-145% of text size
        - tracking (or how compact the letters are)
        - characters in a line→45-90 characters (including space) 
        - main heading→180-200% of main body text
        - secondary headings→130-150% of main body text
        - align text→when in doubt, align text to the left
        - test print
        -
