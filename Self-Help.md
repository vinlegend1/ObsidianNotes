    - Exercise is an evolutionary need
    - We have been evolved to do manual labors. It's not necessarily: " You have to exercise" more so "Your genetics require you to exercise"
    - Strength training to prevent muscle loss and functional loss and basically a lot of diseases
    - Many diseases are preventable just by exercising (74%)
    - Exercising "slows down" aging, or... Lack of activity makes aging run amok
    - Preventive exercises
    - Don't need full 8 hours sleep
- Productivity
    - Triple Two System
        - Allocate **2 mins** for a new habit
        - Don't miss **2 days** in a row, forgive yourself for missing 1 day
        - stick with the habit for **2 years** 
        - Other 2-min stuff
            - get the short stuff (things that can be done in 2 mins) done right away

    - Cal Newport Productivity System
        - Current Reality: A lot on your plate and a lot of interruptions, not much focus. Overwhelmed and stressed
        - > Be Intentional and Strategic
        - The System
        - Steps:
            1. Quarterly planning approach
            2. Weekly planning
            3. Daily planning
        - Systems used to capture and organize
        - trello board
        - google calendar ⇒ for appointments but not for weekly planning
        - habit tracking
        - Quarterly Plans
        - makes plan to progress in areas of life
        - Weekly Plan
        - Planning and Reviewing for the week
        - Weekly review process
            - Go through lists like active projects list, trello boards, calendar, emails
            - make notes on what you want to make progress on each week
        - Daily Plans
        - work on important tasks in the morning (when your energy is high)
            - but important doesn't mean working on urgent tasks
        - timeblocking for focused work
            - Benefits:
                - Intentional about deep work time
                - better plans based on energy levels
                - batch admin tasks into sprints
        - Physical planner for Timeblocking
        - convenient access
        - Perform schedule fixes
            - have an intentional plan but also be able to be flexible by moving the sched around
        - batching of email and admin work
        - schedule sufficient time for tasks
        - Implement a Work Shutdown Routing

    - How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance
        - You need carbon dioxide to efficiently bring in oxygen
        - mechanical and chemical systems
        - most people are over-breathing
            - hypoxic state 
        - sleep apnea
        - personality types can be altered through breathing (apparently)
        - In the lungs, there are small sacs call the alveoli that increases the surface area of the lungs that improve the mechanical aspects of breathing
        - Diaphragm and intercostals muscles>>>
            - responsible to contract and expand the lungs
            - intercostals muscles are found in the rib cage
        - Nerves control muscles
        - Phrenic nerve>>>
            - comes out of the neck
            - form synapses with the diaphram
            - motor nerve
        - 
        - Diaphragmatic breathing is the most "efficient" way to breathe
        - Amygdala↔**the integrative center for emotions, emotional behavior, and motivation**.
        - Hyperventilation↔**rapid or deep breathing, usually caused by anxiety or panic**.
        - 
- Stress
    - hard-wired physical response
    - can be advantageous in the short-term but it's not ideal to be stressed too often
    - adrenal gland produces cortisol + epinephrine = adrenaline
        - also norepinephrine
        - travels to heart
        - adrenaline causes heart to beat faster and raises blood pressure
    - can also affect the stomach or gut
        - increase gut sensitivity to acidity
    - causes you to crave comfort food
    - affects the immune cells
    - affects the length of telomeres in chromosomes
    - view things as challenges instead of stressful things
        - respond more positively
    - Mental Health
    - mental health is our ability to respond to challenges
    - protective factors and risk factors
        - protective factors are like the shield and risk factors are like the poisons to mental health
