## Highlights

> The speed of the pump can be varied with
> 
> * hydraulic/hydrostatic drives - hydraulic coupling between input and output shaft - speed ratio 5 to 1 is controlled by adjusting the volume of oil in the coupling
> * mechanical drives - belt and sheave drive
> * eddy current drive/clutch - magnetic coupling transfer load torque between input and output shaft
> * variable speed drives - inverters - AC drives - adjustable frequency drives - operates by varying the frequency and voltage to the electric motor [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-capacity-modulation-192c2b73aa9#8249fbdf-2a81-4983-b59a-45fc865b89fc)  ^8249fbdf

> Capacity can be regulated at constant speed by
> 
> * throttling
> * bypassing flow
> * changing impeller diameter
> * modifying the impeller

> Throttling is energy inefficient since the energy to the pump is not reduced. Energy is wasted by increasing the dynamic loss. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-capacity-modulation-192c2b73aa9#80e39bdc-2d18-4e8f-a52b-ba75a739078b)  ^80e39bdc

> The discharge capacity can be regulated by leading a part of the discharge flow back to the suction side of the pump. Bypassing the flow is energy inefficient since the energy to the pump is not reduced.

> The change in power consumption, head and volume rate can be estimated with the help of the [affinity laws](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/affinity-laws-d%5F408.html "Affinity laws").
