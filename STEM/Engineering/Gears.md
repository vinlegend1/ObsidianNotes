- Function of Gears>>>
    - adjusting speed ratio
    - adjusting torque ratio
    - converting rotational motion to translational motion

    - What do spur gears do?→transmit power to shafts that are parallel
    - the teeth are {{parallel }}to the axle axis in spur gears
    - produce {{radial reaction loads and not axial}} loads in spur gears
    - When are spur gears usually used?→Usually used for low to medium speed applications (up to 3600 rev/min)
    - Why are spur gears not used in high speed applications?→not often used in high speed applications due to the loud noise they produce
    - benefits of spur gear→simple design, cheap production and maintenance
- Helical Gears

    - What are helical gears?→similar to spur gears but the teeth are angled
    - Why angle in helical gears?>>>
        - So more than one tooth is in contact during operation, leading to its ability to handle more load
        - it's used more in high speed applications as a result. Quiter
    - Cons of helical gears (at least compared to spur gear)?>>>
        - sliding contact between teeth which would lose energy in the form of heat
        - i.e. it's less efficient as spur gear due to tooth slippage
- Bevel Gears
    - ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/ssJGNg5tLGAj_rRwbDQKMbnQwO-NzexSlk5-PSln2yl583CJwYCKO0VKKsAWGdm2eKOHC8dNvTf0c_KWI4HBuCwYLZBtK6ZGPut4iDvK-fJ1P6hTEzb7SrbgIAjo4jcB.png) 
    - where are bevel gears most commonly used?→they're commonly used to transmit power from one shaft to another that are perpendicularly intersecting or at some sort of angle (but usually perpendicular)
- Spiral Bevel Gears

    - What are spiral bevel gears?>>>
        - bevel gears with curved tooth lines.
    - pros and cons of spiral bevel gears>>>
        - Due to higher tooth contact ratio, they are superior to straight bevel gears in efficiency, strength, vibration and noise.
        - On the other hand, they are more difficult to produce. Also, because the teeth are curved, they cause thrust forces in the axial direction

- Worm Gears

    - what are worm gears used for?→they're used to transmit power in 90 deg on non-intersecting shafts 
    - worm hears are good for{{ high shock load}} applications
    - Cons of worm gears>>>
        - low efficiency (close to 15%) due to high friction and associated axial stresses
- Gear Rack or Rack and Pinion

    - converts rotational motion into linear motion
