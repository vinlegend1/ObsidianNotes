However, as the value of the capacitance is increased, it becomes bulky. ~Aside form this, the diode’s peak current increases sharply. In order to obtain a constant DC voltage across the load, the output of the capacitor filter should be passed through a voltage regulator. The simplest type of regulator is shown in figure 6.41 that employs a Zener diode.
