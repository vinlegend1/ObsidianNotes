- Similarity: All relevant dimensionless parameters have the same values for the model & the prototype.
- Similarity generally includes three basic classifications in fluid mechanics:
    - (1) Geometric similarity
    - (2) Kinematic similarity
    - (3) Dynamic similarity
- Buckingham Pi Theorem
    - Definitions:
        - n = the number of independent variables relevant to the problem
        - j’ = the number of independent dimensions found in the n variables
        - j = the reduction possible in the number of variables necessary to be
        - considered simultaneously
        - k = the number of independent pi terms that can be identified to describe the problem, k = n - j
    - Summary of Steps:
        - List and count the n variables involved in the problem.
        - List the dimensions of each variable using {MLTΘ} or {FLTΘ}. Count the number of basic dimensions ( j’) for the list of variables being considered.
        - Find j by initially assuming j = j’ and look for j repeating variables which do not form a pi product. If not successful, reduce j by 1 and repeat the process.
        - Select j scaling, repeating variables which do not form a pi product.
        - Form a pi term by adding one additional variable and form a power product.
        - Algebraically find the values of the exponents which make the product dimensionless. Repeat the process with each of the remaining variables.
        - Write the combination of dimensionless pi terms in functional form:
