        - Planning
            - Coping with uncertainty by formulating courses of action to achieve specified results
        - Three Types of Uncertainty>>>
            - State uncertainty: Occurs when the environment, or a portion of the environment, is considered unstable
            - Effect uncertainty: Occurs when impacts of environmental change are unpredictable
            - Response uncertainty: Arises when the consequences of decisions are unpredictable
            - 
        - Organizational Responses to Uncertainty>>>
            - Defenders: Relying on a primary technology and/or a narrow product line to remain competitive
            - Prospectors: Seeking first-mover advantage by aggressively making things happen and not waiting for them to happen
            - Analyzers: Following the market leader and imitating what works, avoiding expensive R&D mistakes
            - Reactors: Waiting for adversity (e.g., declining sales) to occur before taking corrective action
        - 
        - Balancing Planned Action and Spontaneity in the Twenty-First Century
            - Command-and-Control Model>>>
                - Top-down tight control of operations through exact planning which creates organizational inflexibility to deal with unanticipated events and limited success
            - Contingency Model>>>
                - Planned action balanced with creative flexibility to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to cope with the need for change

            - Management looks at its priorities when deciding how to allocate resources.
            - The A-B-C Priority System
                - A: "Must do" objectives are critical to successful performance.
                - B: "Should do" objectives are necessary for improved performance.
                - C: "Nice to do" objectives are desirable for improved performance but not critical to survival or improved performance.
            - The 80/20 Principle (Pareto Analysis)
