How to improve system?
I think we remove PDFs
Why is it taking longer to get status if the PDFs have been ignored?
Remove PDFs and PPTs and everything else that's not .md
- Pros
	- using the script method allows me to annotate the pseudo PDFs or put in my thoughts and notes
	- disperses the file size into multiple images

Todo list
- [/] create a script that converts PDFs, PPTs, DOCX to images or text (depending on the content)
- [x] remove the non markdown files
- [x] Get Remnote data export to markdown
- [x] Download Pokemon Elite Redux and Rogue 2.0
- [x] Organize Remnote Notes in Obsidian

## Notes for the day
- That was nasty work... git idk how it works
- Maybe you should take a full in-depth course on it

- **Set Up a Class Template**: Create a template with pre-filled headings like "Lecture Summary," "Key Concepts," "Questions," and "References." Every time you start a new note, you can use this template to ensure consistency.
    
- **Use Tags and Dataview Plugin for Filtering**: Since you're using Dataview, consider tagging notes by categories like `#homework`, `#exam-prep`, or `#project`. Then, use Dataview queries to create dynamic lists based on tags, which can help you see, for example, all your “exam prep” notes in one place.
