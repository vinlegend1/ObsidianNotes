- Communication
    - Transfer of information from one person to another
    - Way of reaching others by transmitting ideas, facts, thoughts, feelings and values
    - GOAL: for the receiver to understand the message as intended
    - Essential to every management function
    - Without communication, coordination of work is impossible and the organization can collapse
    - Every act of communication influences the organization, one way or another
- 
- Open Communication
    - Being open to employees is by far more effective than being restrictive
    - Employees respond favourably if they are informed of the problems that the organization is facing
    - Employees can see themselves as partners in the enterprise
    - Empowered on a daily basis to help run the workplace
    - Understand what the business is all about
- Potential Problems
    - Polarization - taking extreme positions on an issue
    - Defensive Reasoning - when person is threatened with losing an argument and abandon logic and reasoning
    - Cognitive Dissonance - internal conflict and anxiety when people receive information that is incompatible with their values, decisions
    - Face-saving - preserving ourselves from attack
- Communication Barriers
    - Arise from human emotions, values and poor listening habits
    - Stems from differences in education, race, sex and socioeconomic status and other factors
    - Involve psychological distance (eg. when resentment between two people exists)
    - People see and hear what we are emotionally “tuned” to see and hear
    - Communication is guided by people’s expectations
- Communication Barriers (Physical)
    - Occurs in the environment
    - Noise, distance, walls, other interferences
    - Surroundings can be altered to influence receiver’s behaviour
- Communication Barriers: Semantics
    - Science of meaning
    - Achieved using symbols - words, pictures, actions
    - Limitations in the symbols with which we communicate
    - Can be a difficult challenge when people from different cultures communicate with each other
- Communication Symbols: Words 
    - Main communication symbol
    - Major difficulty occurs due to multiple meanings
    - Context and social cues can help interpret information
    - Readability must be increased to make speech and writing more understandable to the receiver
- Communication Symbols: Pictures
    - Used to clarify word communication
    - Blueprints, charts, diagrams, maps
- Communication Symbols: Action
    - Nonverbal communication
    - Handshake, smile, raise in pay or being late
    - Failure to praise an employee or failure to provide promised resources can	 send a wrong message to employees
    - We communicate at all times at work regardless of our intentions
    - Credibility gap occurs when there’s a difference between what someone says and does
    - Body language/facial expression (frown from a manager can mean a rejection)
- Communication Credibility Factors
    - Trustworthiness
    - Expertise
    - Dynamism (confidence and enthusiasm)
- Downward Communication
    - Flow of information from higher to lower levels of authority
    - Managers must convey their messages carefully and with candor and warmth, must be open to true dialogues and sensitive to human needs
- Downward Communication: Prerequisites
    - Develop a positive communication attitude
    - Continually work to stay informed; seek relevant information
    - Consciously plan for communication
    - Develop Trust
- Problem: Communication Overload
    - Managers give employees enormous amounts of information which overwhelms them but does not improve understanding
    - Employees receive more than what is needed
- Communication Needs
    - Job instruction
    - Performance Feedback
    - News
    - Social Support
- Upward Communication: Problems
    - Delay - hesitation to take a problem upward
    - Filtering - telling a superior what he/she wants to hear only
    - Short-circuiting - skip one or more steps in communication hierarchy
    - Need for response - if manager does not respond, this will discourage future upward communications
    - Distortion - modification of a message for personal gain
