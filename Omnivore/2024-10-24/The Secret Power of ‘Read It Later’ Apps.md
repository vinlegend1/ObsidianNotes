## Highlights

> What has become exceedingly scarce (and therefore, valuable) is the physical, emotional, attentional, and mental capability to sit quietly and direct focused attention for sustained periods of time. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps#079eeeb6-2432-473f-9860-36b35d448226)  ^079eeeb6

> A [recent article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/overloaded-circuits-why-smart-people-underperform) in the Harvard Business Review puts a name to this new neurological phenomenon: Attention Deficit Trait. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps#fca50adf-5aec-4acc-88dd-aedab42c3342)  ^fca50adf

> The problem is that our entire digital world is geared toward snackable chunks of low-grade information — photos, tweets, statuses, snaps, feeds, cards, etc. To fight the tide you have to redesign your environment — you have to create affordances. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps#24bf9093-49eb-4a13-8b0e-551ea24fdef1)  ^24bf9093

> [Google found](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/) that increasing the number of results per page from 10 to 30 took only half a second longer, but **caused 20% of people to drop off**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps#218841e3-b62a-42eb-981e-2135aad1bf06)  ^218841e3

> There is something deeply, deeply unsatisfying about repeatedly starting something and not finishing it. This is what we experience all day at work, being continuously interrupted by a stream of “emergencies.” The last thing we want after a stressful day starved of wins is to fail even at reading an article. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps#d35e693a-165f-42e6-84df-12267a85cb29)  ^d35e693a

> I’m **time-shifting the curation process** to a time better suited for reading, and (most critically) removed from the temptations, stresses, and biopsychosocial hooks that first lured me in. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps#258dbb97-6714-4b86-a6ea-a681652adb89)  ^258dbb97

> But the pendulum is swinging too far in that direction. Yes, you can be _too_ action-oriented. Ideas, while cheap when compared to effective execution, are still more valuable than many of the other things we spend time on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps#a95d1882-d831-4796-bf2a-e2157f7ac9e9)  ^a95d1882

> There’s another way to learn faster: assimilate and build on the ideas of others. Sure, you won’t understand every tacit lesson their experience gave them, but you can incorporate many of them, and in a fraction of the time it would take you to make every mistake yourself.
