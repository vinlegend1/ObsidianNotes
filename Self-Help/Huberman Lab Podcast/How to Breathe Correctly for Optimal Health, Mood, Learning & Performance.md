- You need carbon dioxide to efficiently bring in oxygen
- mechanical and chemical systems
- most people are over-breathing
    - hypoxic state 
- sleep apnea
- personality types can be altered through breathing (apparently)
- In the lungs, there are small sacs call the alveoli that increases the surface area of the lungs that improve the mechanical aspects of breathing
- Diaphragm and intercostals muscles>>>
    - responsible to contract and expand the lungs
    - intercostals muscles are found in the rib cage
- Nerves control muscles
- Phrenic nerve>>>
    - comes out of the neck
    - form synapses with the diaphram
    - motor nerve
- 
- Diaphragmatic breathing is the most "efficient" way to breathe
- Amygdala↔**the integrative center for emotions, emotional behavior, and motivation**.
- Hyperventilation↔**rapid or deep breathing, usually caused by anxiety or panic**.
