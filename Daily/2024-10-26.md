How to improve system?
I think we remove PDFs
Why is it taking longer to get status if the PDFs have been ignored?
Remove PDFs and PPTs and everything else that's not .md

Todo list
- [ ] create a script that converts PDFs, PPTs, DOCX to images or text (depending on the content)
- [ ] remove the non markdown files
- [ ] Get Remnote data export to markdown
- [ ] Download Pokemon Elite Redux and Rogue 2.0
