- Structure of Crystalline Solids
- Crystalline material>>>
    - one in which the atoms are situated in a repeating or periodic array over large atomic distances
    - repetitive 3D pattern
    - the opposite is amorphous material
- Unit cells
    - smallest repeat entities in crystal structures
    - FCC (face-centered cubic)
        - <insert image of FCC>
        - cube edge length: $a = 2R\sqrt{2}$ 
    - number of atoms per unit cell>>>
        - $N = N_i + N_f/2 + N_c/8$ 
    - coordination number>>>
        - the number of atoms or ions immediately surrounding a central aotm in a complex or crystal
        - ex. FCC coordination number = 12
    - atomic packaging factor (APF)
        - $APF = \frac{V_a}{V_T} = \frac{\text{volume of atoms in a unit cell}}{\text{total unit cell volume}}$ 
    - BCC (body-centered cubic)
        - cube edge length $a = \frac{4R}{\sqrt{3}}$
    - Hexagonal close-packed crystal (HCP)
- Polymorphism and allotropy>>>
    - some metals and nonmetals may have more than one crystal structure
    - called allotropy when talking about elemental solids
- Crystal Systems
    - unit cell geometry is completely defined in terms of 6 parameters
- Crystallographic Points, Directions, and Planes
    - kinda like vectors
- Crystallographic Directions
    - represented in a [] notation $[uvw]$
    - $\frac{x_2 - x_1}{a}, \frac{y_2 - y_1}{b}, \frac{z_2 - z_1}{c}$
- Directions in Hexagonal Crystals
- Crystallographic Planes
    - miller indices $(h, k, l)$
    - 

      $$h = \frac{na}{A}, k = \frac{nb}{B}, l = \frac{nc}{C}$$

       
- Linear and Planar Densities
    - 

      $$LD = \# \text{ atoms on direction } \vec{v}/||\vec{v}||$$

      
- Polycrystalline Crystals
    - most crystalline solids are composed of a collection of many small crystals or grains
    - grain boundary
        - exists some atomic mismatch within the region where two grains meet
- Amsotropy
    - directionary of properties
    - associated with the variance of atomic or ionic spacing w/ crystallographic direction
    - isotropic
        - substances in which measured properties are independent of the direction of measurement
- X-Ray Diffusion
    - determine crystal structures
    - Bragg's law
