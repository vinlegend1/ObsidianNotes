## Highlights

> * hydraulic loss - due to disk friction in the impeller, rapid change in flow directions and velocity changes throughout the pump
> * volumetric loss - due to internal re-circulation caused by wear in rings and bushes [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/bep-the-best-efficiency-point-of-a-pump-192c2bd9c43#8e4df446-c932-4650-8dd6-123bd3be64ce)  ^8e4df446

> The maximum efficiency for a pump is normally in its "design point" - also called
