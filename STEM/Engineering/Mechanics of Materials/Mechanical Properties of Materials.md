- Tension and Compression Test
    - The strength of a material depends on its ability to {{sustain a load without undue deformation or failure}}.
        - Tension and Compression Test
            - it is used primarily to determine the relationship between the average normal stress and average normal strain in many engineering materials such as {{metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites}}.
            - Before testing, {{two small punch marks}} are placed along the specimen’s uniform length. Measurements are taken of both the specimen’s {{initial cross-sectional area, }}$A_0${{, and the gauge-length distance }}$L_0${{ between the punch marks}}. For example, when a metal specimen is used in a tension test it generally has an initial {{diameter of 0.5 in. (13 mm) and a gauge length of 2 in. (50 mm)}} 
            - $\delta = L - L_0$ between the punch marks on the specimen may be measured using {{either a caliper}} or a mechanical or optical device called an {{extensometer}} 
            - Sometimes, however, this measurement is not taken, since it is also possible to read the strain directly by using an {{electrical-resistance strain gauge}}

- Elastic Behavior
    - Elastic behavior of the material occurs when the strains in the specimen are within the light orange region shown in Fig. 3–4. Here the curve is actually a straight line throughout most of this region, so that the stress is proportional to the strain. The material in this region is said to be linear elastic. The upper stress limit to this linear relationship is called the {{proportional limit}}. If the stress slightly exceeds the proportional limit, the curve tends to bend and flatten out as shown. This continues until {{the stress reaches the elastic limit}}. Upon reaching this point, if the load is removed the specimen will {{still return back to its original shape}}. Normally for steel, however, the elastic limit is seldom determined, since {{it is very close to the proportional limit and therefore rather difficult to detect}}.
- Yielding
    - A slight increase in stress above the elastic limit will result in {{a breakdown of the material and cause it to deform permanently}}. This behavior is called {{yielding}}, and it is indicated by the rectangular dark orange region of the curve. The stress that causes {{yielding }}is called {{the yield stress or yield point}}, and the deformation that occurs is called {{plastic deformation.}} Although not shown in Fig. 3–4, for low- carbon steels or those that are hot rolled, the yield point is often distinguished by two values. The upper yield point occurs first, followed by {{a sudden decrease in load-carrying capacity to a lower yield point}}. Notice that once the yield point is reached, then as shown in Fig. 3–4, the specimen will {{continue to elongate (strain) without any increase in load}}. When the material is in this state, it is often referred to as being {{perfectly plastic}}.
- Stress Hardening
    - When yielding has ended, an increase in load can be supported by the specimen, resulting in a curve that rises continuously but becomes flatter until it reaches a {{maximum stress referred to as the ultimate stress}}. The rise in the curve in this manner is called {{strain hardening}}, and it is identified in Fig. 3–4 as the region in light green.
- Necking
    - Up to the ultimate stress, as the specimen elongates, {{its cross-sectional area will decrease}}. This decrease is fairly uniform over the specimen’s entire gauge length; however, just after, at the ultimate stress, the cross-sectional area will {{begin to decrease in a localized region of the specimen}}. As a result, a constriction or {{“neck” tends to form}} in this region as the specimen elongates further, Fig. 3–5a. This region of the curve due to necking is indicated in dark green in Fig. 3–4. Here the stress–strain diagram tends to curve downward until the specimen breaks at the fracture stress

- Ductile Materials
    - One way to specify the ductility of a material is to report its {{percent elongation}} or {{percent reduction in area}} at the time of fracture. The {{percent elongation}} is the specimen’s fracture strain expressed as a percent

- Creep and Fatigue
- Creep.
    - When a material has to support a load for a very long period of time, it may {{continue to deform until a sudden fracture occurs or its usefulness is impaired}}. This time-dependent permanent deformation is known as {{creep}}. Normally creep is considered when {{metals and ceramics are used for structural members or mechanical parts that are subjected to high temperatures}}. For some materials, however, such as polymers and composite materials—including {{wood or concrete}}—temperature is not an important factor, and yet creep can occur strictly from{{ long-term load application}}. As a typical example, consider the fact that a rubber band will not return to its original shape after being released from a stretched position in which it was held for a very long period of time. In the general sense, therefore, {{both stress and or temperature play a significant role in the rate of creep}}.
    - For practical purposes, when creep becomes important, {{a member is usually designed to resist a specified creep strain}} for a given period of time. An important mechanical property that is used in this regard is called the creep strength. {{This value represents the highest stress the material can withstand during a specified time without exceeding an allowable creep strain}}. The creep strength will vary with temperature, and for design, a given temperature, duration of loading, and allowable creep strain must all be specified. For example,{{ a creep strain of 0.1% per year }}has been suggested for steel in bolts and piping.
- 
- Fatigue.
    - {{When a metal is subjected to repeated cycles of stress or strain, it causes its structure to break down, ultimately leading to 3 fracture.}} This behavior is called fatigue, and it is usually responsible for a large percentage of failures in connecting rods and crankshafts of engines; steam or gas turbine blades; connections or supports for bridges, railroad wheels, and axles; and other parts subjected to cyclic loading. In all these cases, fracture will occur at a stress that is less than the material’s yield stress.
    - The nature of this failure apparently results from the fact that {{there are microscopic imperfections, usually on the surface of the member, where the localized stress becomes much greater than the average stress acting over the cross section}}. As this higher stress is cycled, it {{leads to the formation of minute cracks}}.
    - This value is determined from an {{S–N diagram}} as the maximum stress the material can resist when subjected to a specified number of cycles of loading
