    - Planning
        - Coping with uncertainty by formulating courses of action to achieve specified results
    - Three Types of Uncertainty>>>
        - State uncertainty: Occurs when the environment, or a portion of the environment, is considered unstable
        - Effect uncertainty: Occurs when impacts of environmental change are unpredictable
        - Response uncertainty: Arises when the consequences of decisions are unpredictable
        - 
    - Organizational Responses to Uncertainty>>>
        - Defenders: Relying on a primary technology and/or a narrow product line to remain competitive
        - Prospectors: Seeking first-mover advantage by aggressively making things happen and not waiting for them to happen
        - Analyzers: Following the market leader and imitating what works, avoiding expensive R&D mistakes
        - Reactors: Waiting for adversity (e.g., declining sales) to occur before taking corrective action

    - Balancing Planned Action and Spontaneity in the Twenty-First Century
        - Command-and-Control Model>>>
            - Top-down tight control of operations through exact planning which creates organizational inflexibility to deal with unanticipated events and limited success
        - Contingency Model>>>
            - Planned action balanced with creative flexibility to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to cope with the need for change

    - The Essentials of Planning
        - A Plan>>>
            - Is a specific documented intention consisting of an objective (end) and an action statement (means)
                - States what, when, and how something is to be done

    - Organizational Mission
        - A clear, formally written, and publicized statement that guides the organization by:
            - Defining the organization for key stakeholders
            - Creating an inspiring vision of the organization
            - Outlining how the vision will be accomplished
            - Establishing key priorities
            - Stating a common goal and fostering togetherness
            - Creating a philosophical anchor for the organization

            - Empowering organization members
            - 
    - Objectives
        - An objective is a commitment to achieve a measurable result within a specified period.
        - Writing Good Objectives Objectives should be expressed in quantitative, measurable, and concrete terms.
            - What specific result is to be achieved?
            - When is the result to be achieved?
            - How is the result to be measured?
            - Who will be responsible for achieving the result?
        - The Importance of Objectives (Uses of)
            - Target: Sets specific goals to achieve
            - Measuring stick: Gauges how much was achieved
            - Commitment: Encourages pursuit of the objective
            - Motivation: Provides a challenge for achievement
        - The Means-Ends Chain of Objectives
            - Achievement of lower-level objectives creates a means for achieving higher-level objectives.

    - Priorities
        - Priorities are a ranking of goals, objectives, or activities in order of importance to guide the order and timing of decisions.
        - Management looks at its priorities when deciding how to allocate resources.
        - The A-B-C Priority System
            - A: "Must do" objectives are critical to successful performance.
            - B: "Should do" objectives are necessary for improved performance.
            - C: "Nice to do" objectives are desirable for improved performance but not critical to survival or improved performance.
        - The 80/20 Principle (Pareto Analysis)
            - A majority of causes, inputs, or effort tends to produce     a majority of results, outputs, or rewards.
