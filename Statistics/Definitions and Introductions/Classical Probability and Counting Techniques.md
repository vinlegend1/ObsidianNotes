- Counting Theory
    - Possibilities come from experiments, processes that lead to outcomes.
    - The set of all outcomes in an experiment is called a sample space.
    - The goal is to count all the possible outcomes in an experiment.
    - A set of techniques used for identifying the total number enumerating the elements of the sample space.
- Multiplication Rule>>>
    - If a task can be performed in ways, and if for each of these, a second task can be performed in ways, and for each of the first two, a third task can be performed in ng ways, and so forth, then the sequence of k tasks can be performed in
- Addition Rule>>>
    - Suppose a task A can be done in m ways, task B in n ways, and both can be accomplished in k different ways. Then, task A or B can be done in...
