    - Toxicology>>>
        - The study of the harmful effects of chemicals on humans and other organisms.
        - {{Toxicity}} is a measure of the harmfulness of a substance. 
        - Any synthetic or natural chemical can be harmful if ingested in a large enough quantity.
    - In vivo testing>>>
        - The most widely used method for determining toxicity is to expose a population of live laboratory animals to measured doses of a specific substance under controlled conditions.
    - Dose Response Curve

    - Many factors determine the harmful health effects of chemicals
        - Toxicity also depends on {{genetic makeup}}, which determines an individual’s sensitivity to a particular toxin. 
        - Some individuals are {{sensitive to a number of toxins}}—a condition known as {{multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)}}. 
        - How well the body’s {{detoxification systems}} (such as the liver, lungs, and kidneys) work.
    - Many factors determine the harmful health effects of chemicals>>>
        - Solubility―water-soluble toxins and oil- or fat-soluble toxins. 
        - {{Persistence, or resistance to breakdown}} such as DDT and PCBs. 
        - {{Biological magnification}}, in which the concentrations of some potential toxins in the environment increase as they pass through the successive trophic levels of food chains and webs.
    - The damage to health resulting from exposure to a chemical is called the response.
        - {{Acute effect}} is an immediate or rapid harmful reaction ranging from dizziness and nausea to death.
        - {{Chronic effect}} is a permanent or long-lasting consequence (kidney or liver damage, for example) of exposure to a single dose or to repeated lower doses of a harmful substance.
    - There are other ways to estimate the harmful effects of chemicals 
        - Case reports>>>
            - provide information about people suffering some adverse health effect or death after exposure to a chemical. 
        - Epidemiological studies>>>
            - which compare the health of people exposed to a particular chemical (the experimental group) with the health of a similar group of people not exposed to the agent (the control group).
        - Limitations of case reports and epidemiological studies>>>
            - Too few people have been exposed to high enough levels of a toxic agent
            - Takes a long time
            - People are exposed to many different toxic agents
            - New technologies or chemicals
            - Different sensitivity to chemicals
    - All methods for estimating toxicity levels and risks{{ have serious limitations}}.
    - Why do we know so little about the harmful effects of chemicals?
        - Only 10% of 80,000+ registered synthetic chemicals in commercial use have been thoroughly screened for toxicity, and only 2% have been adequately tested to determine whether they are carcinogens, mutagens, or teratogens.
