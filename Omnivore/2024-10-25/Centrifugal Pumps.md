## Highlights

> The most common is the volute pump - where fluid enters the pump through the eye of the impeller which rotates at high speed. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-192c2a925a7#d42e5e8e-1e66-44b8-aa07-990139b7cfb2)  ^d42e5e8e

> The fluid accelerates radially outward from the pump chasing and a vacuum is created at the impellers eye that continuously draws more fluid into the pump. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-192c2a925a7#8c013b45-2a49-4c6d-b575-eb84fda5b545)  ^8c013b45

> The energy transferred to the liquid corresponds to the velocity at the edge or vane tip of the impeller. The faster the impeller revolves or the bigger the impeller is, the higher will the velocity of the liquid energy transferred to the liquid be. This is described by the [Affinity Laws](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/affinity-laws-d%5F408.html "Affinity Laws").

> If the discharge of a centrifugal pump is pointed straight up into the air the fluid will pumped to a certain height - or head - called the **shut off head**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-192c2a925a7#f34b3adf-71e9-466c-81be-1ba110cb2f64)  ^f34b3adf

> This maximum head is mainly determined by the outside diameter of the pump's impeller and the speed of the rotating shaft. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-192c2a925a7#937a91ca-42aa-4d4c-9ae1-020a65b0d792)  ^937a91ca

> A pump does not create pressure, it only creates flow. The gauge pressure is a measurement of the resistance to flow. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-192c2a925a7#8a48454f-7b18-4c57-8bba-a539c3d782fa)  ^8a48454f

> the main reason for using head instead of pressure to measure a centrifugal pump's energy is that the pressure from a pump will change if the [specific gravity (weight)](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/density-specific-weight-gravity-d%5F290.html "Specific gravity") of the liquid changes, but the head will not [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-192c2a925a7#35590cfe-bb9b-482c-abfb-ddcf6117c44b)  ^35590cfe

> * it is important to understand that the pump will pump all fluids to the same height if the shaft is turning at the same rpm
> 
> The only difference between the fluids is the amount of power it takes to get the shaft to the proper rpm. The higher the [specific gravity](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/density-specific-weight-gravity-d%5F290.html "Specific gravity") of the fluid the more power is required.

> * [Centrifugal Pumps](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/centrifugal-pumps-d%5F54.html "Centrifugal pumps") are "**constant head machines**"
> 
> Note that the latter is not a constant pressure machine, since pressure is a function of head and density. The head is constant, even if the density (and therefore pressure) changes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/centrifugal-pumps-192c2a925a7#e581c33c-f87f-4b57-9f6d-88a0cec14cf0)  ^e581c33c
