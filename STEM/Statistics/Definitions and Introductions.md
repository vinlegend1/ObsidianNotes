- Classical Probability and Counting Techniques
    - Counting Theory
        - Possibilities come from experiments, processes that lead to outcomes.
        - The set of all outcomes in an experiment is called a sample space.
        - The goal is to count all the possible outcomes in an experiment.
        - A set of techniques used for identifying the total number enumerating the elements of the sample space.
    - Multiplication Rule>>>
        - If a task can be performed in ways, and if for each of these, a second task can be performed in ways, and for each of the first two, a third task can be performed in ng ways, and so forth, then the sequence of k tasks can be performed in
    - Addition Rule>>>
        - Suppose a task A can be done in m ways, task B in n ways, and both can be accomplished in k different ways. Then, task A or B can be done in...

- Introduction
    - Parameters vs. Statistics
        - Parameters↔numerical values that describe the characteristics of a population
            - examples: $\mu$ (mean); $\sigma$(standard deviation)
        - Statistics↔numerical values that describe the characteristics of a sample
            - examples: $\bar{x}$ (mean) s (standard deviation)

        - mean, median, mode

    - Measures of position>>>
        - quartiles
            - Are measures that divide a set of data points into four parts
            - Q1 (25%), Q2 (50%), Q3 (75%)

    - Measures of variance>>>

          $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$

          $$s^2 = \frac{\Sigma (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$

    - skewness
        - When skewness is 0, {{median is also the mean}} 
        - Mean<median, skew is {{negative}} 
        - Mean>median, skew is {{positive}} 
    - kurtosis→how fat or thin the distribution is 
        - {{Leptokurtic }}- kurtosis measures are near the tails and is positive
        - {{Platykurtic }}- kurtosis measures are near center and is negative
        - {{Mesokurtic }}- kurtosis = 0
