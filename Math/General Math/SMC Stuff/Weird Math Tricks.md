- Stirling's Aoproximation>>>
    - 

      $$n! = \sqrt{2\pi}n^{n + 1/2}e^{-n}$$

       
- Triangle Inequality>>>
    - 

      $$a^2 + b^2 > c^2$$

      
- factors and ingenius factoring>>>
    - 

      $$x + xy + y = a\\
x(1+y) + y = a\\
x(1+y) + (1+y) = a + 1\\
(x+1)(y+1) = a+1\\
\textbf{find factors for a+1 if x and y stated to be > 0}$$

       
- Rational Root Theorem>>>
    - factors of constant term divided by factors of leading coefficient +-
- Triangle Geometry Problems Strategy>>>
    - solve all the possible right triangle first
    - apply any identities on the way
    - solve for the trig functions by equating in some way
    - solve for a trig function and then solve for rest to get back to the lengths of sides or measure of angles

- Algebra Tricks>>>
    - simplify/manipulate equation such that the two sides are similar enough or solvable
- 
- Divisible tricks>>>
    - 2 - if even
    - 3 - if sum of digits divisible by 3
    - 4 - if last 2 digits divisible by 4
    - 5 - if 0 or 5 last digit
    - 6 - if number is both divisible by 2 and 3
    - 7 â‡’ rest - 2last divisible by 7
    - 8 - number formed by last 3 digits is divisible by 8
    - 9 - if sum of digits divisible by 9
    - 10 - if you know the rules
    - 11 - (sum of digits in odd places) - (sum of digits in even places) = 0 or divisible by 11
