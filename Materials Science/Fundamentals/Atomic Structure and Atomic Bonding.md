- Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding
- atomic number
- electrons
- energy quantization
- quantum numbers
- p.m.f of electron
- electron configurations
- periodic table
- atomic bonding in solids
    - bonding forces and energies
    - <insert image from book>
- Covalent Bonding
- Bond Hybridization
- Metallic Bonding
    - found in metals and alloys
    - valence electrons are not bound in any particular atom in the solid, more or less they're "free"
    - "sea of electrons"
    - the remaining nonvalence electron and atomic nuclei form ion cores
- Secondary bonding (intermolecular forces)
    - van der Waals
    - induced dipole bonds
    - polar-induced
    - permanent dipole
- Mixed bonding
    - most aren't purely one (ionic or covalent)
    - $%IC = [1 - e^{-\frac{(x_A - x_B)^2}{4}}] \times 100%$ $\%IC = [1 - e^{-\frac{(x_A-x_b)^2}{4}}]\times 100\%$
- In general, these materials are associated with these types of bonds>>>
    - ionic↔ceramics
    - covalent↔polymers
    - metallic↔metals
    - IMF↔molecular solids
