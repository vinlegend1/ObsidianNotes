    - Phthalates
        - Definition: Chemical compounds used as plasticizers and solvents
        - Types:
            - Diethyl phthalate (DEP)
            - Diisononyl phthalate (DINP)
            - Diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP)

            - Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)
            - Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)
            - Dimethyl phthalate (DMP)
        - Uses:
            - Plastics manufacturing: makes plastic more flexible, durable, and transparent
            - Personal care products: used as a solvent in fragrance and cosmetic products
            - Medical devices: used in tubing, blood bags, and other medical equipment

        - Note: Phthalates have been linked to various health concerns such as hormonal imbalances, reproductive issues, and developmental problems. Some countries have banned the use of certain phthalates in specific products, while others have imposed regulations on their use.
    - Dioxin
        - What are dioxins?→Dioxins are a group of toxic chemical compounds that are produced as byproducts of certain industrial processes, such as waste incineration, chemical manufacturing, and paper bleaching.
        - What is the most toxic dioxin?→The most toxic dioxin is called 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and it is often used as a reference point for measuring the toxicity of other dioxins.
        - What are the dangers of dioxin exposure?→Dioxins are highly toxic and can cause a range of health effects in humans and animals, including cancer, developmental and reproductive disorders, immune system damage, and hormonal imbalances. Exposure to dioxins can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact with contaminated materials, such as food, water, or soil. Children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of dioxin exposure.
        - What are some applications of dioxins in industry?→Dioxins are not intentionally produced, but are rather byproducts of certain industrial processes, such as waste incineration and chemical manufacturing. Some industries, such as paper and pulp mills, have been known to release dioxins into the environment through their manufacturing processes.
        - What are some cases where dioxin exposure has been fatal to human life?→One of the most well-known cases of dioxin exposure occurred in Seveso, Italy in 1976, when a chemical accident released a cloud of dioxin into the surrounding area, resulting in widespread contamination and health effects for the local population. Agent Orange, a herbicide used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, contained high levels of dioxin and has been linked to health effects in both U.S. veterans and Vietnamese civilians. Dioxin contamination has also been found in communities living near waste incinerators and other sources of pollution.

        - Toxicology>>>
            - The study of the harmful effects of chemicals on humans and other organisms.
            - {{Toxicity}} is a measure of the harmfulness of a substance. 
            - Any synthetic or natural chemical can be harmful if ingested in a large enough quantity.
        - In vivo testing>>>
            - The most widely used method for determining toxicity is to expose a population of live laboratory animals to measured doses of a specific substance under controlled conditions.

        - Many factors determine the harmful health effects of chemicals
            - Toxicity also depends on {{genetic makeup}}, which determines an individual’s sensitivity to a particular toxin. 
            - Some individuals are {{sensitive to a number of toxins}}—a condition known as {{multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)}}. 
            - How well the body’s {{detoxification systems}} (such as the liver, lungs, and kidneys) work.
        - Many factors determine the harmful health effects of chemicals>>>
            - Solubility―water-soluble toxins and oil- or fat-soluble toxins. 
            - {{Persistence, or resistance to breakdown}} such as DDT and PCBs. 
            - {{Biological magnification}}, in which the concentrations of some potential toxins in the environment increase as they pass through the successive trophic levels of food chains and webs.
        - The damage to health resulting from exposure to a chemical is called the response.
            - {{Acute effect}} is an immediate or rapid harmful reaction ranging from dizziness and nausea to death.
            - {{Chronic effect}} is a permanent or long-lasting consequence (kidney or liver damage, for example) of exposure to a single dose or to repeated lower doses of a harmful substance.
