- Classification of Materials
- metals
- ceramicsâ†’between metallica and nonmetallics; oxides, nitrides, carbides
- polymers>>>
    - include familiar plastics and rubber materials
    - are organic based on C,H, O, N, Si, etc.
    - large molecular structures, often chainlike, often have backbone of carbon atoms
    - ex: polyethylene (PE), nylon, poly vinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), silicone rubber
    - typically have low densities
    - generally dissimilar mechanical characteristics to those of the metallic and ceramic materials
- composite>>>
    - composed of two (or more) individual materials (metals, ceramics, polymers)
    - to achieve a combination of properties
    - ex. fiberglass (small glass fibers are embedded within polymeric material)
        - glass (strong + stiff + brittle) + fiber (flexible) = fiberglass (strong, stiff, flexible, low density)
    - carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite
- Elastomers>>>
    - polymeric materials that display rubber-like behavior
- Natural materials>>>
    - those that occur in nature
- Foams>>>
    - typically polymeric materials that have porosites (contain a large volume fraction of small pores), which are often used for cushions and packagin
- Advanced Materials>>>
    - Semiconductors
    - Biomaterials
        - must be biocompatible
            - i.e. compatible w/ body tissues and fluids which they are in contact over acceptable time periods
    - Smart materials>>>
        - are able to sense changes in their environment and then respond to these changes in predetermined manners
    - Nanomaterials>>>
        - could be any material, but structure has to be on the order of nanometers ($10^{-9} m$)
