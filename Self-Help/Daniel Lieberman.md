- Exercise is an evolutionary need
- We have been evolved to do manual labors. It's not necessarily: " You have to exercise" more so "Your genetics require you to exercise"
- Strength training to prevent muscle loss and functional loss and basically a lot of diseases
- Many diseases are preventable just by exercising (74%)
- Exercising "slows down" aging, or... Lack of activity makes aging run amok
- Preventive exercises
- Don't need full 8 hours sleep
