- What is a shortest path from the starting point to the destination point?
- **GRAPH THEORY** is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations of objects.
- Origin of Graph Theory

    - This is Konigsberg, now known as Kaliningrad, in Russia. In the early 1700’s, people from this town posed a particular question.
        - “Is it possible to take a walk through town, crossing each of the seven bridges just once, and ending up wherever you started?"
- The famous Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler heard of the problem, solved it (its not possible) and in the process invented Graph Theory.
- Undirected Graph
    - An **undirected graph** 𝐺 consists of a set 𝑉(𝐺) of vertices and a set 𝐸(𝐺) of edges that which join two vertices.
    - **Vertices **𝑢 and 𝑣 are **adjacent **if they are joined by an **edge**. This edge is denoted by 𝑢𝑣.

    - The **order **of 𝐺, denoted by |𝑉(𝐺)|, is the number of vertices in 𝐺.
    - The **size **of 𝐺, denoted by |𝐸(𝐺)|, is the number of edges in 𝐺.

    - The degree of the vertex 𝑢, denoted by 𝑑𝑒𝑔_𝐺 (𝑢), is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex 𝑢.
    - The neighborhood of 𝑢, denoted by 𝑁_𝐺 (𝑢), is the set of all vertices that are adjacent to 𝑢.

- Walking on a Graph
- A walk of length 𝑘 from vertex 𝑣_0 to vertex 𝑣_𝑘 is a sequence 𝑣_0, 𝑣_1,…,𝑣_(𝑘−1), 𝑣_𝑘 of vertices such that two consecutive vertices are joined by an edge.
    - Denote this walk by
        - (𝑣_0, 𝑣_1,…,𝑣_(𝑘−1), 𝑣_𝑘)
- Connected vs Disconnected Graph
    - A graph is said to be connected if there is always a path from a vertex to another.
    - Otherwise, 𝐺 is disconnected.
- Weighted Graph
    - We say that graph 𝐺 is a weighted graph if all the edges of 𝐺 are assigned with numerical values (weights).
- Directed Graph
    - A **directed graph** 𝐷 consists of a set 𝑉(𝐷) of vertices and a set 𝐴(𝐷) of arcs that are formed using (ordered) pairs of vertices in 𝑉(𝐷).
    - An arc from 𝑢 to 𝑣 is written as [𝑢,𝑣]. In this case, we say 𝑢 is the **initial vertex** while the vertex 𝑣 is the **terminal vertex**.
    - Similar to undirected graphs, the **order is the number of vertices** of the digraph and the **size is the number of arcs**.

- Djikstra's Algorithm
    - Is a tool for determining a shortest path from a starting vertex 𝑠 to any destination vertex.
    - It applies to connected simple graphs (directed or undirected).
    - State of a vertex: distance value and status label
    - The distance value of a vertex represents an estimate of its distance from vertex 𝑠. This may be updated everytime Dijkstra’s algorithm is used.
    - Status labels: Permanent or Temporary.
    - Once a vertex reaches permanent status label, that means we have determined its shortest distance from the starting point.
    - At each step of the algorithm, one vertex is designated as current.
