- ???
- Failure
    - Simple fracture↔separation of a body into two or more pieces in response to an imposed stress that is static
        - ductile fracture>>>
            - preferred over brittle→brittle occurs suddenly and catastrophically without warning
        - brittle fracture→rapid crack propragation
    - fracture mechanisms>>>
        - ductile materials can exhibit brittle fracture
        - measured fracture strengths for most materials are significantly lower than those predicted by theoretical calculations based on atomic bonding energies
            - discrepancy caused by presence of microscopic flaws
            - flaws are often called stress raisers
        - a crack is assumed to be ellipsical and the maximum stress at the crack tip may be approximated by
            - 

              $$\sigma_m = 2 \sigma_0 \sqrt{\frac{q}{\rho_t}}$$

              
            - where $\rho_t$ is radius of curvatures
        - [Stress Concentration Factor](../../Engineering/Mechanics of Materials/Axial Load/Stress Concentration Factor.md)
    - fracture toughness
        - an expression has been developed that relates critical stress for crack propagation ($\sigma_c$) and crack length (a) as
            - 

              $$K_c = Y \sigma_c \sqrt{\pi a}$$

              
        - K_c fracture toughness
            - measure of a material's resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present
            - units of $MPa \sqrt{m}$ or $ksi \sqrt{in}$ 
        - Y dimensionless parameter
            - depends on both crack and specimen sizes and geometries as wel as on the matter of load application
        - Fracture toughness testing
            - Impact testing techniques
                - Charpy and Izod ⇒ two standardized tests
                - measure the impact energy
            - Ductile-to-Brittle Transition
                - determine whether a material experiences a ductile to brittle transition w/ decreasing temperature, and if so, the range of temperature over which it occurs
- Fatigue
    - form of failure that occurs in structures subjected to dynamic and fluctuating stresses
    - [Fatigue.](../../Engineering/Mechanics of Materials/Mechanical Properties of Materials/Fatigue.md)
    - S-N curve>>>
        - as with other mechanical characteristics, the fatigure properties of materials can be determined from laboratory simulation tests
        - the higher the magnitude of stress, the smaller the number of cycles the material is capable of sustaining before failure
    - fatigue limit (endurance limit)>>>
        - limiting stress level below which fatigue will not occur
- Factors that affect fatigue life>>>
    - mean stress
    - surface effects
    - design factors
    - surface treatments
- case hardening>>>
    - a technique that enhances surface hardness and fatigue life for steel alloys
- thermal fatigue>>>
    - normally induced at elevated temperatures by fluctuating thermal stresses
- corrosion fatigue>>>
    - failure that occurs by the simultaneous action of a cyclic stress and chemical attack
