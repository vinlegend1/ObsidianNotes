## Highlights

> Low pressure at the suction side of a pump may cause the fluid to start boiling with
> 
> * reduced efficiency
> * cavitation
> * damage [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/pumps-npsh-net-positive-suction-head-192c28c1d50#52d8f3d2-fe9b-4385-a3a6-cc034fb8134b)  ^52d8f3d2

> Boiling starts when the pressure in the liquid is reduced to the vapor pressure of the fluid at the actual temperature.

> Based on the [Energy Equation](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/mechanical-energy-equation-d%5F614.html "The energy equation") \- the **suction head** in the fluid close to the impeller\*) can be expressed as the sum of the **static** and **velocity head** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/pumps-npsh-net-positive-suction-head-192c28c1d50#c0c37c28-5149-4cff-aefb-ec0c131908b4)  ^c0c37c28

> We can not measure the suction head "close to the impeller". In practice we can measure the head at the pump suction flange. Be aware that - depending of the design of the pump - the contribution to the NPSH value from the suction flange to the impeller can be substantial.

what does this mean?

> The NPSHr, called as the Net Suction Head as required by the pump in order to prevent cavitation for safe and reliable operation of the pump.
> 
> The required NPSHr for a particular pump is in general determined experimentally by the **pump manufacturer** and a part of the documentation of the pump. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/pumps-npsh-net-positive-suction-head-192c28c1d50#9dba0f7f-375d-4e87-9f89-772e5488ecec)  ^9dba0f7f

> The available NPSHa  of the system should always exceeded the required NPSHr of the pump to avoid vaporization and cavitation of the impellers eye. The available NPSHa should in general be significant higher than the required NPSHr to avoid that head loss in the suction pipe and in the pump casing, local velocity accelerations and pressure decreases, start boiling the fluid on the impellers surface.

> Note that required NPSHr increases with the square of capacity. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/pumps-npsh-net-positive-suction-head-192c28c1d50#08b13521-db6f-4007-8e2b-cdf3a2e9b1b5)  ^08b13521

> Note that the NPSH specifications provided by manufacturers in general are for use with **cold water**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/pumps-npsh-net-positive-suction-head-192c28c1d50#13c2f7f6-3803-40f0-8854-2c799a577b63)  ^13c2f7f6
