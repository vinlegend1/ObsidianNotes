- Diffusion
- many reactions and processes that are important in the treatment of materials rely on the transfer of mass either with a specific solid or from a liquid, a gas, or another solid phase
- diffusion couple
    - copper and nickel
        - heated up and were sticked together, they diffuse
        - interdiffusion or impurity diffusion
    - There is a net drift or transport of atoms from high to low concentration regions
- self-diffusion
    - exchanging positions of the same types
- diffusion mechanisms
    - vacancy diffusion
    - interstitial diffusion
- Fick's first law
    - time-dependent process
    - diffusion flux
    - 

      $$J = \frac{M}{At} [\frac{kg}{m^2 \cdot s}]$$

      
    - 

      $$J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}$$

      
        - similar to heat conduction equation
- Fick's second law
    - non steady-state diffusion
    - the diffusion flux and the concentration gradient at some particular point in a solid vary with time
    - 

      $$\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{d}{dx} (D \frac{dC}{dx})$$

      
- Factors that Influence Diffusion
    - Diffusing Species
        - depends on the type of species
        - Ex. carbon self-diffusion vs. carbon-$\alpha$-iron @ 500 deg C
            - 3x10^-21 vs 1.4x10^-12 m^2
    - Temperature
        - similar or analagous to rate constant
        - 

          $$D = D_0 e^{-Qd/RT}$$

          
        - 

          $$k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$$

           
- Diffusion in Semi-conducting Materials
    - solid-state diffusion application
        - fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits
        - very precise concentrations of an impurity must be incorporated
            - achieved by atomic diffusion (at least one way)
- Other Diffusion Paths
    - may also occur along dislocations, grain boundaries, and external surfaces
        - sometimes called short-circuit diffusion paths
        - 

          $$\frac{C_x-C_0}{C_s - C_0} = 1 - erf{\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}}$$
