- Imperfections in Solids
- Point defects
    - vacancy, vacant lattice site
    - number of vacancies $N_v$ for a given quantity of material depends on and increases w/ temperature according to
        - 

          $$N_v = Ne^{-\frac{Q_v}{kT}}$$

          
        - where N = total # of atomic sites (atomes/m^3)
        - Q_v = energy required for the formation fo vacancy
        - k = Boltzmann's constant→$1.38 \times 10^{-23} J/atom \cdot K \text{ or }\\ 8.62 \times 10^{-5} eV/atom \cdot K$
    - self-interstitial
        - an atom from the crystal that is crowded into an interstitial site
            - a small void space that under ordinary circumstances is not occupied
- Impurities in solids
    - most metals are not highly pure, they are alloys
    - solute and solvent are terms usually used
    - substitutional and interstitial (two types of solid impurity point defects)
    - Hume-Rothery rules
        - determines degree solvent dissolves solute
            1. Atomic size factor
            2. crystal structure→must be the same for appreciable solid solubility 
            3. electronegativity→the trigger $\Delta \chi$ intermetallic compund 
            4. valencies→a metal has tendency to dissolbe another metal of higher valancy
- Specification of composition
    - weight percent
    - atom percent
        - 

          $$\rho_{ave} = \frac{100}{\frac{c_1}{\rho_1}+\frac{c_2}{\rho_2}} \text{ density }$$

          
        - 

          $$A_{ave} = \frac{C_1'A_1 + C_2'A_2}{100} \text{ atomic weight }$$

          
- dislocations>>>
    - linear defects
    - Burgers vector
- Interfacial defects
    - boundaries>>>
        - external boundaries
        - grain boundaries
        - phase boundaries→exist in multiphase materials
        - twin boundaries→special type of grain boundary; mirror lattice symmetry
- 
- Bulk or volume defects
    - atomic vibration
    - can be thought of as a defect
    - at any instant of time, not all atoms vibrate at the same frequency and amplitude or w/ same energy
- Microscopy
    - optical microscopy
        - light microschope is used to study microstructure
    - electron microscopy
        - when some structural elements are too fine or small to permit observation using optical microscopy
    - transmission electron microscopy→electron beam passes thru specimen
    - scanning electron microscopy→e-beam to surface, reflected electron displayed
    - scanning probe microscopy→topographical map (on an atomic scale)
- Grain-sized determination
    - the mean intercept length $\bar{l}$, a measure of grain diameter may be determined
    - 

      $$\bar{l} = \frac{L_T}{PM}$$

      
    - often determined when the properties of polycrystalline and single-phase materials are under consideration
    - let G = grain-size #, n = ave. # g/in^2 at 100x magnification
        - 

          $$n = 2^{G-1}$$

          
        - 

          $$n_M(\frac{M}{100})^2 = 2^{G-1}$$

          
    - intercept length $\bar{l}$ to ASTM grain-sze number
        - 

          $$G = -6.6457 log \bar{l} - 3.298 \text{ (} \bar{l} \text{ in mm) }$$

          
        - 

          $$G = -6.6353 log \bar{l} - 12.6 \text{ (} \bar{l} \text{ in in.) }$$
