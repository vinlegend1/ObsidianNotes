- **Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)** 
    - Kruskal’s and Prim’s Algorithm
- Path and Circuit
    - A **path **from a vertex u to a vertex v of a graph is a sequence of edges starting from u and ending in v such that the end of each edge other than the last one is the start of the next edge in the sequence.
    - The **length of a path** is the sum of the weights of the edges of the path.
- Trees
    - A tree is a **connected **undirected graph with **no simple circuits**.

- Spanning Trees
    - A spanning tree obtained from a graph is a tree which uses all the original vertices.
    - A minimal spanning tree (MST) is a spanning tree with the total weight of its edges as small as possible.
    - **Application**: The concept of MST is used to find the least expensive way to connect a set of locations, terminals, computers, etc.

- Kruskal’s Algorithm
    - 1. Begin by choosing the shortest edge.
    - 2. Choose the shortest edge remaining that does not complete a cycle with any of those already chosen. (If there are two or more possibilities, choose any one of them at random.)
    - 3. Repeat Step 2 until you have chosen n-1 edges altogether. The result is a minimum-length spanning tree.
- Prim's Algorithm
    - 1. Start with any vertex chosen random, and consider this as a tree.
    - 2. Look for the shortest edge which joins a vertex on the tree to a vertex not on the tree, and add this to the tree. (If there is more than one such edge, choose any one of them at random.)
    - 3. Repeat Step 2 until all the vertices of the graph are on the tree; the tree is then a minimum-length spanning tree.
    - should yield the same weight as Kruskal but maybe different connections
