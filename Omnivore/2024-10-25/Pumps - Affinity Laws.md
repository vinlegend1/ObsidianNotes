## Content
##  Turbo machines affinity laws can be used to calculate volume capacity, head or power consumption in centrifugal pumps when changing speed or wheel diameters.

**==The Affinity Laws==**  ==of centrifugal pumps or fans indicates the influence on volume capacity, head (pressure) and/or power consumption of a pump or fan due to==

* ==change in==   **==speed==**  ==of wheel - revolutions per minute (rpm)==
* ==geometrically similarity - change in==   **==impeller diameter==**

Note that there are  two sets  of affinity laws:

* affinity laws for  a specific centrifugal pump  \- to approximate head, capacity and power curves for different motor speeds and /or different diameter of impellers
* affinity laws for  a family of geometrically similar centrifugal pumps  \- to approximate head, capacity and power curves for different motor speeds and /or different diameter of impellers

### Pump Affinity Laws for a  Specific Centrifugal Pump 

#### Volume Capacity

The volume capacity of a centrifugal pump can be expressed like

> _q1 / q2\= (n1 / n2) (d1 / d2) (1)_ 
> 
> _where_ 
> 
> _q = volume flow capacity (m3 /s, gpm, cfm, ..)_ 
> 
> _n = wheel velocity - revolution per minute - (rpm)_ 
> 
> _d = wheel diameter (m, ft)_ 

#### Head or Pressure

The head or pressure of a centrifugal pump can be expressed like

> _dp1 / dp2\= (n1 / n2)2(d1 / d2)2(2)_ 
> 
> _where_ 
> 
> _dp = [ head ](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/static-pressure-head-d%5F610.html "static pressure head") or pressure (m, ft, Pa, psi, ..)_ 

#### Power

The power consumption of a centrifugal pump can be expressed as

> _P1 / P2\= (n1 / n2)3 (d1 / d2)3 (3)_ 
> 
> _where_ 
> 
> _P = power (W, bhp, ..)_ 

#### **Changing Wheel Velocity** 

![centrifugal pumps affinity laws](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/322x206,sCKqKgRYK2M1jDOAI6wB3eXOaW__GwSRCwb95gi2NezU/https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/docs/documents/408/centrifugal-pump-wheel-velocity.png "centrifugal pumps affinity laws")

If the   **wheel diameter is constant**  \- change in pump wheel velocity can simplify the affinity laws to

##### Volume Capacity

> _q1 / q2\= (n1 / n2) (1a)_ 

##### Head or Pressure

> _dp1 / dp2\= (n1 / n2)2(2a)_ 

##### Power

> _P1 / P2\= (n1 / n2)3 (3a)_

 **Note!** ==If the speed of a pump is increased with==   _==10%==_ 

* ==the volume flow increases with==   _==10%==_
* ==the head increases with==   _==21%==_
* ==the power increases with==   _==33 %==_

If we want to increase the volume flow capacity of an existing system with   _10%_  we have to increase the power supply with   _33%_ .

#### Pump Affinity Laws Calculator - Changing Wheel Velocity

Replace the default values with the actual values. The calculator is generic and can be used with all common units as long as the use is consistent.

####   **Changing the Impeller Diameter** 

If wheel velocity is constant   **a change in impeller diameter**  simplifies the affinity laws to

##### Volume Capacity

> _q1 / q2\= d1 / d2(1b)_ 

##### Head or Pressure

> _dp1 / dp2\= (d1 / d2)2(2b)_ 

##### Power

> _P1 / P2\= (d1 / d2)3 (3b)_

#### Pump Affinity Laws Calculator - Changing Wheel Diameter

Replace the default values with the actual values. The calculator is generic and can be used with all common units as long as the use of units is consistent.

 _q1 \- volume capacity - (m3 /s, gpm, cfm, ..)_ 

 _dp1 \- head or pressure (m, ft, Pa, psi, ..)_ 

 _P1 \- power (W, bhp)_ 

 _d1 \- initial wheel diameter (m, in, ft ...)_ 

 _d2\- final wheel diameter (m, in, ft ..)_ 

#### Example - Pump Affinity Laws - Changing Pump Speed

The pump speed is changed when the impeller size is constant. The initial flow is   _100 gpm_ , the initial head is   _100 ft_ , the initial power is   _5 bhp_ , the initial speed is   _1750 rpm_  and the final speed   _3500 rpm_ .

The final flow capacity can be calculated with (1a):

> _q2\= q1 n2/ n1_ 
> 
> _\= (100 gpm) (3500 rpm) / (1750 rpm)_ 
> 
> _\=  200  gpm_ 

The final head can be calculated with (2a):

> _dp2\= dp1 (n2/ n1 )2_
> 
> _\= (100 ft) ((3500 rpm) / (1750 rpm))2_
> 
> _\=  400  ft_ 

The final power consumption can be calculated with (3a):

> _P2\= P1 (n2/ n1 )3_ 
> 
> _\= (5 bhp) ((3500 rpm) / (1750 rpm))3_ 
> 
> _\=  40  bhp_ 

#### Example - Pump Affinity Laws - Changing Impeller Diameter

The diameter of the pump impeller is reduced when the pump speed is constant. The diameter is changed from   _8 to 6 inches_ .

The final flow capacity can be calculated with   _(1b)_  :

> _q2\= q1 (d2/ d1 )_ 
> 
> _\= (100 gpm) ((¨6 in) / (8 in))_ 
> 
> _\=  75  gpm_ 

The final head can be calculated with   _(2b)_  :

> _dp2\= dp1 (d2/ d1 )2_
> 
> _\= (100 ft) ((6 in) / (8 in))2_
> 
> _\=  56.3  ft_ 

The final power consumption can be calculated with   _(3b)_  :

> _P2\= P1 (d2/ d1 )3_ 
> 
> _\= (5 bhp) ((6 in) / (8 in))3_ 
> 
> _\=  2.1  bhp_ 

### Pump Affinity Laws for a  Family of Geometrically Similar Pumps 

The volume capacity can be expressed like

> _q1 / q2\= (n1 / n2)(d1 / d2)3 (4)_ 
> 
> _where_ 
> 
> _q = volume flow capacity (m3 /s, gpm, cfm, ..)_ 
> 
> _n = wheel velocity - revolution per minute - (rpm)_ 
> 
> _d = wheel diameter_ 

#### Head or Pressure

The head or pressure of a centrifugal pump can be expressed like

> _dp1 / dp2\= (n1 / n2)2(d1 / d2)2(5)_ 
> 
> _where_ 
> 
> _dp = [ head ](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/static-pressure-head-d%5F610.html "static pressure head") or pressure (m, ft, Pa, psi, ..)_ 

#### Power

The power consumption of a centrifugal pump can be expressed as

> _P1 / P2\= (n1 / n2)3 (d1 / d2)5 (6)_ 
> 
> _where_ 
> 
> _P = power (W, bhp, ..)_ 

Note that the [ affinity laws for fans ](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fan-affinity-laws-d%5F196.html "fan affinity laws") are not identical with pumps.
