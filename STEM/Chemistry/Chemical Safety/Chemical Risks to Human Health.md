- Why worry about Chemical safety?>>>
    - Chemicals used everyday at home and in the workplace can be hazardous.
- Risks and Hazards
    - Approximately 1,000 new chemicals come onto the market every year, and about 100,000 chemical substances are used on a global scale.
    - Hazard―Potential of a substance to cause damage
    - Risk―Measure of the probability that harm will occur under defined conditions of exposure to a chemical
    - risks are expressed as {{probability}} 
    - Risk Assessment>>>
        - hazard identification
        - probability of risk
        - consequences of risk
    - Risk Management>>>
        - comparative risk management―how does it compare to other risks?
        - risk reduction
        - risk reduction strategy
        - financial commitment
- 
- Types of hazards
- Chemical hazards―from harmful chemicals in air, water, soil, food, and human-made products. 
- Biological hazards―from more than 1,400 pathogens that can infect humans. 
- Natural hazards―such as fire, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and storms. 
- Cultural hazards―such as unsafe working conditions, unsafe highways, criminal assault, and poverty.
- Lifestyle choices―such as smoking, making poor food choices, drinking too much alcohol, and having unsafe sex.
-

    - cancer
- Some toxic chemicals>>>
    - [Vinyl chloride](../../Chemistry/Chemicals/Vinyl chloride.md)

- Types of Exposure>>>
    - Air and inhalation
    - Skin and eye contact/ absorption
    - Food, water, and ingestion
    - Transfer across the placenta
- Some chemicals can cause cancers, mutations, and birth defects
- There are three major types of potentially toxic agents. 
- {{Carcinogens }}are chemicals, types of radiation, or certain viruses that can {{cause or promote cancer}}. 
- {{Mutagens }}are chemicals or forms of radiation that cause{{ mutations, or changes, in the DNA molecules}} found in cells, or that increase the frequency of such changes. 
- {{Teratogens }}are chemicals that cause harm or birth defects to a fetus or embryo
- 
- Our body’s immune system protects us against disease and harmful substances by forming antibodies that render invading agents harmless, but some chemicals interfere with this process.
    - Arsenic―DNA damage in immune cells
    - Methylmercury―effects on inflammatory pathways 
    - [Dioxins](Dioxin.md)―immunosuppression
- Some natural and synthetic chemicals in the environment, called {{neurotoxins}}, can harm the human nervous system, causing the following effects.
    - Behavioral changes. 
    - Learning disabilities. 
    - Retardation. 
    - Attention deficit disorder. 
    - Paralysis. 
    - Death.
    - Examples of neurotoxins>>>
        - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)

- 
- The main industrial sources of atmospheric mercury are {{mining, coal burning, and other industrial activities}} 
- About 50 tons of elemental mercury are emitted each year from {{U.S. coal-burning powerplants}}, with lesser amounts coming from{{ oil- and gas-burning}} units. 
- Recommendations to reduce mining and coal-burning, reduce or eliminate mercury in the production of batteries, paints, and chlorine by no later than 2020.

-
