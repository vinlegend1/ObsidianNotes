## Equations Charts and Tables

## Key Concepts 
- Use Affinity Laws with Caution
	- Geometric similarity
	- rotational speed must not be too large
	- there might be cavitation when rotational speed it too high
- cavitation is caused by a lowered pressure state compared to vapor pressure causing the liquid to boil and create bubbles
- pressure at the throat or suction must be >= vapor pressure
- large machines are more efficient than smaller ones because flow passages are larger
