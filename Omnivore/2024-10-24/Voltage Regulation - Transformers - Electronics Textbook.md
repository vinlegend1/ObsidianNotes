## Highlights

> “Full-load” means the point at which the transformer is operating at maximum permissible secondary current. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#baf8f1e2-2497-41f6-a4fa-cec896af2f02)  ^baf8f1e2

> Notice how the output voltage decreases as the load gets heavier (more current). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#091c80f3-6d00-40d3-ab5b-c991493f8659)  ^091c80f3

> So, we see that our output (secondary) voltage spans a range of 9.990 volts at (virtually) no load and 9.348 volts at the point we decided to call “full load.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#686d09e7-4631-4c22-bb60-2f71b8316de2)  ^686d09e7

> a good power transformer should exhibit a regulation percentage of less than 3%. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#ee29af50-1bbe-4220-8456-16ca3b759de5)  ^ee29af50

> Inductive loads tend to create a condition of worse voltage regulation, so this analysis with purely resistive loads was a “best-case” condition. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#13d6f3d0-bd14-4952-ab51-47e0d2a865a5)  ^13d6f3d0

> There are some applications, however, where poor regulation is actually desired. One such case is in discharge lighting, where a step-up transformer is required to initially generate a high [voltage](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-1/voltage-current-practical-circuit/) (necessary to “ignite” the lamps), then the voltage is expected to drop off once the lamp begins to draw current. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#7f68b122-41c5-4db7-b5a3-8771c5b4c859)  ^7f68b122

> Another application is in current control for AC arc welders, which are nothing more than step-down transformers supplying low-voltage, high-current power for the welding process. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#fc820763-335e-4365-8061-995299dad78a)  ^fc820763

> ### Known Disadvantages of Ferroresonant Transformers
> 
> Unfortunately, these devices have equally noteworthy disadvantages: they waste a lot of energy (due to hysteresis losses in the saturated core), generating _significant_ heat in the process, and are intolerant of frequency variations, which means they don’t work very well when powered by small engine-driven generators having poor speed regulation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#f7b7b1ca-a7cc-4f00-993e-3cabf0fa6d16)  ^f7b7b1ca

> A _ferroresonant_ transformer is a special transformer designed to regulate voltage at a stable level despite wide variation in input voltage. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/voltage-regulation-transformers-electronics-textbook-192bd055315#f774f9db-c2bc-41c6-853b-659798be8380)  ^f774f9db
