## Content
##  BEP is where the pump is most efficient.

A practical pump will never be able to convert all its kinetic energy to pressure energy. Parts of the energy will always be internal or external lost. 

**Internal Losses**

* ==hydraulic loss - due to disk friction in the impeller, rapid change in flow directions and velocity changes throughout the pump==
* ==volumetric loss - due to internal re-circulation caused by wear in rings and bushes==

**External Losses**

* mechanical loss - due to friction in seals and bearings

==The maximum efficiency for a pump is normally in its "design point" - also called==

* **==BEP - or the "Best Efficiency Point"==**

For pumps operating in all other positions - the efficiency will be less than in BEP.
