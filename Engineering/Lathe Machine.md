        - no matter what {{material}}, it is the {{shape of the material}} that determines how it can be used
        - height of tool must be set {{to match the center of the lathe axis}} 
        - High speed steel>>>
            - Can be used on most turning operations on most materials (except for tougher alloys)
            - a plank of high speed steel needs to be grinded to the desired shape

            - can handle much more heat than [{{HSS}}](Lathe Machine/Lathe Cutting Tools/Lathe Cutting tools/High speed steel.md){{ }} 
            - can cut tougher metals and at higher speeds
        - Carbide insert tool>>>
            - an insert of sharp carbide thing into a steel shank
