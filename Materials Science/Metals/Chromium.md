- Chromium Use Cases>>>
    - Stainless steel production: Chromium is a key component of stainless steel alloys, which are widely used in construction, automotive, and other industries. Chromium provides the steel with resistance to corrosion and rust, as well as enhanced hardness and durability.
    - Plating and coating: Chromium is used in plating and coating processes to improve the appearance, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance of metal parts and products.
    - Aerospace: Chromium is used in aerospace and aviation industries for its high strength and heat resistance properties. It is used in components such as turbine blades and exhaust nozzles.
    - Refractory materials: Chromium compounds are used in the manufacture of refractory materials such as bricks and crucibles, which can withstand high temperatures and harsh chemical environments.
    - Pigments and dyes: Chromium is used in the production of pigments and dyes, particularly for paints, inks, and textiles.
    - Wood preservation: Chromium compounds are used in wood preservation to protect wood from decay, insects, and other types of damage.
