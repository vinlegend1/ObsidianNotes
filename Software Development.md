        - The fastest way to expose all Prisma CRUD actions is to import `resolvers` from the output folder and just use it in the `buildSchema` function known from TypeGraphQL:  
        - .
            ```
            import { resolvers } from "@generated/type-graphql";

const schema = await buildSchema({
  resolvers,
  validate: false,
});
            ```
        - if you need more control
        - .
            ```
            import { crudResolvers, relationResolvers } from "@generated/type-graphql";
            ```
        - with Apollo
        - .
            ```
            import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
import { startStandaloneServer } from "@apollo/server/standalone";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const server = new ApolloServer<MyContext>({
  schema, // from previous step
});
const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
  context: () => ({ prisma }),
  listen: { port: 4000 },
});

        - **Performance vs scalability**>>>
            - A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.[1](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html)
            - Another way to look at performance vs scalability:>>>
                - If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
                - If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

        - **Latency vs throughput**>>>
            - **Latency** is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.
            - **Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.
            - Generally, you should aim for **maximal throughput** with **acceptable latency**.

        - **Consistency patterns**>>>
            - With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data. Recall the definition of consistency from the [CAP theorem](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cap-theorem) - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#weak-consistency)**Weak consistency**
            - After a write, reads may or may not see it. A best effort approach is taken.
            - This approach is seen in systems such as memcached. Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games. For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#eventual-consistency)**Eventual consistency**
            - After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds). Data is replicated asynchronously.
            - This approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email. Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#strong-consistency)**Strong consistency**
            - After a write, reads will see it. Data is replicated synchronously.
            - This approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes. Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.

        - **Availability patterns**>>>
            - There are two main patterns to support high availability: **fail-over** and **replication**.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#fail-over)**Fail-over**[**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#active-passive)**Active-passive**
            - With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.
            - The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standy or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby. Only the active server handles traffic.
            - Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#active-active)**Active-active**
            - In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.
            - If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers. If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.
            - Active-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-failover)**Disadvantage(s): failover**>>>
                - Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.
                - There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#replication)**Replication****Master-slave replication**[**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#master-slave-and-master-master)
            - The master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves, which serve only reads. Slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion. If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.

                - You'll need a load balancer or you'll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write.
                - Most master-master systems are either loosely consistent (violating ACID) or have increased write latency due to synchronization.
                - Conflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.

                - There is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.
                - Writes are replayed to the read replicas. If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.
                - The more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.
                - On some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.
                - Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.

            - In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:>>>

            - A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) to an IP address.
            - DNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level. Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup. Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays. DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the [time to live (TTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live).>>>
                - **NS record (name server)** - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
                - **MX record (mail exchange)** - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
                - **A record (address)** - Points a name to an IP address.
                - **CNAME (canonical)** - Points a name to another name or `CNAME` (example.com to [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) or to an `A`record.
            - Services such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) and [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) provide managed DNS services. Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:>>>

                    - Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance

[ __Source: Why use a CDN__ ](https://www.creative-artworks.eu/why-use-a-content-delivery-network-cdn/)
            - A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user. Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JSS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content. The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.
            - Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:>>>
                - Users receive content at data centers close to them
                - Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#push-cdns)**Push CDNs**
            - Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server. You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN. You can configure when content expires and when it is updated. Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.
            - Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs. Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#pull-cdns)**Pull CDNs**
            - Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content. You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN. This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the server.
            - A [time-to-live (TTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) determines how long content is cached. Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.
            - Sites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-cdn)**Disadvantage(s): CDN**>>>
                - CDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.
                - Content might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.
                - CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.

            - Load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases. In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client. Load balancers are effective at:>>>
                - Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
                - Preventing overloading resources
                - Helping eliminate single points of failure
            - Load balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.
            - Additional benefits include:>>>
                - **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations>>>
                    - Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server
                - **Session persistence** - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions
            - To protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in [active-passive](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#active-passive) or [active-active](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#active-active) mode.
            - Load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:>>>
                - Random
                - Least loaded
                - Seesion/cookies
                - [Round robin or weighted round robin](http://g33kinfo.com/info/archives/2657)

            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#layer-4-load-balancing)**Layer 4 load balancing**
            - Layer 4 load balancers look at info at the [transport layer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#communication) to decide how to distribute requests. Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet. Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing [Network Address Translation (NAT)](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-4-load-balancing/).
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#layer-7-load-balancing)**layer 7 load balancing**
            - Layer 7 load balancers look at the [application layer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#communication) to decide how to distribute requests. This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies. Layer 7 load balancers terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server. For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.
            - At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#horizontal-scaling)**Horizontal scaling**
            - Load balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability. Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called **Vertical Scaling**. It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.

                - Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers>>>
                    - Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures
                    - Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a [database](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#database) (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent [cache](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cache) (Redis, Memcached)
                - Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out

[ __Source: Wikipedia__ ](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Proxy_concept_en.svg)
            - A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public. Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.
            - Additional benefits include:>>>
                - **Increased security** - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
                - **Increased scalability and flexibility** - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
                - **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations>>>
                    - Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server

            - Separating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently. Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers.
            - The **single responsibility principle** advocates for small and autonomous services that work together. Small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth.
            - Workers in the application layer also help enable [asynchronism](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#asynchronism).
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#microservices)**Microservices**
            - Related to this discussion are [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), which can be described as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services. Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-definied, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. [1](https://smartbear.com/learn/api-design/what-are-microservices)

            - A relational database like SQL is a collection of data items organized in tables.
            - **ACID** is a set of properties of relational database [transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction).>>>
                - **Atomicity** - Each transaction is all or nothing
                - **Consistency** - Any tranaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
                - **Isolation** - Excuting transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially
                - **Durability** - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so
            - There are many techniques to scale a relational database: **master-slave replication**, **master-master replication**, **federation**, **sharding**, **denormalization**, and **SQL tuning**.

[ __Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million users__ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg5onp8TU6Q)
            - Federation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function. For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: **forums**, **users**, and **products**, resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag. Smaller databases result in more data that can fit in memory, which in turn results in more cache hits due to improved cache locality. With no single central master serializing writes you can write in parallel, increasing throughput.

                - Federation is not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables.

[ __Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns__ ](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)
            - Sharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data. Taking a users database as an example, as the number of users increases, more shards are added to the cluster.
            - Similar to the advantages of [federation](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#federation), sharding results in less read and write traffic, less replication, and more cache hits. Index size is also reduced, which generally improves performance with faster queries. If one shard goes down, the other shards are still operational, although you'll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss. Like federation, there is no single central master serializing writes, allowing you to write in parallel with increased throughput.
            - Common ways to shard a table of users is either through the user's last name initial or the user's geographic location.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-sharding)**Disadvantage(s): sharding**>>>
                - You'll need to update your application logic to work with shards, which could result in complex SQL queries.
                - Data distribution can become lobsided in a shard. For example, a set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others.>>>
                    - Rebalancing adds additional complexity. A sharding function based on [consistent hashing](http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/9/the-magic-of-consistent-hashing.html) can reduce the amount of transferred data.
                - Joining data from multiple shards is more complex.

        - **Denormalization**>>>
            - Denormalization attemps to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance. Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins. Some RDBMS such as [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) and Oracle support [materialized views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view) which handle the work of storing redudant information and keeping redundant copies consistent.
            - Once data becomes distributed with techniques such as [federation](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#federation) and [sharding](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sharding), managing joins across data centers further increases complexity. Denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins.
            - In most systems, reads can heavily number writes 100:1 or even 1000:1. A read resulting in a complex database join can be very expensive, spending a significant amount of time on disk operations.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-denormalization)**Disadvantage(s): denormalization**>>>
                - Data is duplicated.
                - Constraints can help redundant copies of information stay in sync, which increases complexity of the database design.
                - A denormalized database under heavy write load might perform worse than its normalized counterpart.

        - **SQL tuning**>>>
            - SQL tuning is a broad topic and many [books](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=sql+tuning) have been written as reference.
            - It's important to **benchmark** and **profile** to simulate and uncover bottlenecks.>>>
                - **Benchmark** - Simulate high-load situations with tools such as [ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html).
                - **Profile** - Enable tools such as the [slow query log](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html) to help track performance issues.
            - Benchmarking and profiling might point you to the following optimizations.

                - MySQL dumps to disk in contiguous blocks for fast access.
                - Use `CHAR` instead of `VARCHAR` for fixed-length fields.>>>
                    - `CHAR` effectively allows for fast, random access, whereas with `VARCHAR`, you must find the end of a string before moving onto the next one.
                - Use `TEXT` for large blocks of text such as blog posts. `TEXT` also allows for boolean searches. Using a `TEXT` field results in storing a pointer on disk that is used to locate the text block.
                - Use `INT` for larger numbers up to 2^32 or 4 billion.
                - Use `DECIMAL` for currency to avoid floating point representation errors.
                - Avoid storing large `BLOBS`, store the location of where to get the object instead.
                - `VARCHAR(255)` is the largest number of characters that can be counted in an 8 bit number, often maximizing the use of a byte in some RDBMS.

                - Columns that you are querying (`SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`) could be faster with indices.
                - Indices are usually represented as self-balancing [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
                - Placing an index can keep the data in memory, requiring more space.
                - Writes could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated.
                - When loading large amounts of data, it might be faster to disable indices, load the data, then rebuild the indices.

        - **NoSQL**>>>
            - NoSQL is a collection of data items represented in a **key-value store**, **document-store**, **wide column store**, or a **graph database**. Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code. Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor [eventual consistency](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#eventual-consistency).
            - **BASE** is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases. In comparison with the [CAP Theorem](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cap-theorem), BASE chooses availability over consistency.>>>
                - **Basically available** - the system guarantees availability.
                - **Soft state** - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.
                - **Eventual consistency** - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that period.
            - In addition to choosing between [SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sql-or-nosql), it is helpful to understand which type of NoSQL database best fits your use case(s). We'll review **key-value stores**, **document-stores**, **wide column stores**, and **graph databases** in the next section.

        - **Key-value store**>>>
            - Abstraction: hash table
            - A key-value store generally allows for O(1) reads and writes and is often backed by memory or SSD. Data stores can maintain keys in [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order), allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges. Key-value stores can allow for storing of metadata with a value.
            - Key-value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly-changing data, such as an in-memory cache layer. Since they offer only a limited set of operations, complexity is shifted to the application layer if additional operations are needed.
            - A key-value store is the basis for more complex system systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database.

        - Document store>>>
            - Abstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values
            - A document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc), where a document stores all information for a given object. Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself.  __Note, many key-value stores include features for working with a value's metadata, blurring the lines between these two storage types.__ 
            - Based on the underlying implementation, documents are organized in either collections, tags, metadata, or directories. Although documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other.
            - Some document stores like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-architecture) and [CouchDB](https://blog.couchdb.org/2016/08/01/couchdb-2-0-architecture/) also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries.[DynamoDB](undefined.md) supports both key-values and documents.
            - Document stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occasionally changing data.

            - Abstraction: nested map `ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>`
            - A wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair). A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table). Super column families further group column families. You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row. Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.
            - Google introduced [Bigtable](undefined.md) as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source [HBase](https://www.mapr.com/blog/in-depth-look-hbase-architecture) often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and [Cassandra](http://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/architecture/architectureIntro_c.html) from Facebook. Stores such as BigTable, HBase, and Cassandra maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of selective key ranges.
            - Wide column stores offer high availability and high scalability. They are often used for very large data sets.

            - In a graph database, each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes. Graph databases are optimized to represent complex relationships with many foreign keys or many-to-many relationships.
            - Graphs databases offer high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network. They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources.

            - Caching improves page load times and can reduce the load on your servers and databases. In this model, the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution.
            - Databases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions. Popular items can skew the distribution, causing bottlenecks. Putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic.
            - **Disadvantage(s): cache**>>>
                - Need to maintain consistency between caches and the source of truth such as the database through [cache invalidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms).
                - Need to make application changes such as adding Redis or memcached.

            - [Reverse proxies](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server) and caches such as [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) can serve static and dynamic content directly. Web servers can also cache requests, returning responses without having to contact application servers.

            - Your database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration, optimized for a generic use case. Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#application-caching)**Application caching**
            - In-memory caches such as Memcached and Redis are key-value stores between your application and your data storage. Since the data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk. RAM is more limited than disk, so [cache invalidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms) algorithms such as [least recently used (LRU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) can help invalidate 'cold' entries and keep 'hot' data in RAM.
            - Redis has the following additional features:>>>
                - Persistence option
                - Built-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists
            - There are multiple levels you can cache that fall into two general categories: **database queries** and **objects**:>>>
                - Row level
                - Query-level
                - Fully-formed serializable objects
                - Fully-rendered HTML
            - Generaly, you should try to avoid file-based caching, as it makes cloning and auto-scaling more difficult.

            - Whenever you query the database, hash the query as a key and store the result to the cache. This approach suffers from expiration issues:>>>
                - Hard to delete a cached result with complex queries
                - If one piece of data changes such as a table cell, you need to delete all cached queries that might include the changed cell

            - See your data as an object, similar to what you do with your application code. Have your application assemble the dataset from the database into a class instance or a data structure(s):>>>
                - Remove the object from cache if its underlying data has changed
                - Allows for asynchronous processing: workers assemble objects by consuming the latest cached object
            - Suggestions of what to cache:>>>

            - The application is responsible for reading and writing from storage. The cache does not interact with storage directly. The application does the following:>>>
                - Look for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss
                - Load entry from the database
                - Add entry to cache
                - Return entry
            - ```
def get_user(self, user_id):
    user = cache.get("user.{0}", user_id)
    if user is None:
        user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}", user_id)
        if user is not None:
            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))
    return user
```
            - [Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is generally used in this manner.
            - Subsequent reads of data added to cache are fast. Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading. Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn't requested.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-cache-aside)**Disadvantage(s): cache-aside**>>>
                - Each cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay.
                - Data can become stale if it is updated in the database. This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.
                - When a node fails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency.
        - **Write-through**>>>

[ __Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns__ ](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)
            - The application uses the cache as the main data store, reading and writing data to it, while the cache is responsible for reading and writing to the database:>>>
                - Application adds/updates entry in cache
                - Cache synchronously writes entry to data store
                - Return
            - Application code:
            - ```
set_user(12345, {"foo":"bar"})
```
            - Cache code:
            - ```
def set_user(user_id, values):
    user = db.query("UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}", user_id, values)
    cache.set(user_id, user)
```
            - Write-through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation, but subsequent reads of just written data are fast. Users are generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data. Data in the cache is not stale.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-write-through)**Disadvantage(s): write through**>>>
                - When a new node is created due to failure or scaling, the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database. Cache-aside in conjunction with write through can mitigate this issue.
                - Most data written might never read, which can be minimized with a TTL.
        - **Write-behind (write-back)**>>>

[ __Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns__ ](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)
            - In write-behind, tha application does the following:>>>
                - Add/update entry in cache
                - Asynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-write-behind)**Disadvantage(s): write-behind**>>>
                - There could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.
                - It is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.

            - You can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently accessed cache entry prior to its expiration.
            - Refresh-ahead can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future.

            - Asynchronous workflows help reduce request times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line. They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#message-queues)**Message queues**
            - Message queues receive, hold, and deliver messages. If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow:>>>
                - An application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status
                - A worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete
            - The user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background. During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed. For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.
            - **Redis** is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost.
            - **RabbitMQ** is popular but requires you to adapt to the 'AMQP' protocol and manage your own nodes.
            - **Amazon SQS**, is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#task-queues)**Task queues**
            - Tasks queues receive tasks and their related data, runs them, then delivers their results. They can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally-intensive jobs in the background.
            - **Celery** has support for scheduling and primarily has python support.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#back-pressure)**Back pressure**
            - If queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance. [Back pressure](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2012/05/apply-back-pressure-when-overloaded.html) can help by limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue. Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later. Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

            - HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server. It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request. HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.

            - TCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an [IP network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol). Connection is established and terminated using a [handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking). All packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through:>>>
                - Sequence numbers and [checksum fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Checksum_computation) for each packet
                - [Acknowledgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks)) packets and automatic retransmission
            - If the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets. If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped. TCP also implements [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data)) and [congestion control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion#Congestion_control). These guarantees cause delays and generally results in less efficient transmission than UDP.
            - To ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage. It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a [memcached](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#memcached) server. [Connection pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool) can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.
            - TCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical. Some examples include web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH.
            - Use TCP over UDP when:>>>
                - You need all of the data to arrive in tact
                - You want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput

            - UDP is connectionless. Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level. Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all. UDP does not support congestion control. Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient.
            - UDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet. This is useful with [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.
            - UDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.
            - Use UDP over TCP when:>>>
                - You need the lowest latency

[ __Source: Crack the system design interview__ ](http://www.puncsky.com/blog/2016/02/14/crack-the-system-design-interview/)
            - In an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server. The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program. Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls. Popular RPC frameworks include [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), and [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/).
            - RPC is a request-response protocol:>>>
                - **Client program** - Calls the client stub procedure. The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.
                - **Client stub procedure** - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.
                - **Client communication module** - OS sends the message from the client to the server.
                - **Server communication module** - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.
                - **Server stub procedure** - Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.
                - The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.
            - Sample RPC calls:
            - ```
GET /someoperation?data=anId

POST /anotheroperation
{
  "data":"anId";
  "anotherdata": "another value"
}
```
            - RPC is focused on exposing behaviors. RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.
            - Choose a Native Library aka SDK when:>>>
                - You know your target platform.
                - You want to control how your "logic" is accessed
                - You want to control how error control happens off your library
                - Performance and end user experience is your primary concern
            - HTTP APIs following **REST** tend to be used more often for public APIs.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-rpc)**Disadvantage(s): RPC**>>>
                - RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.
                - A new API must be definied for every new operation or use case.
                - It can be difficult to debug RPC.
                - You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box. For example, it might require additional effort to ensure [RPC calls are properly cached](http://etherealbits.com/2012/12/debunking-the-myths-of-rpc-rest/) on caching servers such as [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/).
        - **Representational state transfer (REST)**>>>
            - REST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server. The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources. All communication must be stateless and cacheable.
            - There are four qualities of a RESTful interface:>>>
                - **Identify resources (URI in HTTP)** - use the same URI regardless of any operation.
                - **Change with representations (Verbs in HTTP)** - use verbs, headers, and body.
                - **Self-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP)** - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.
                - [**HATEOAS**](http://restcookbook.com/Basics/hateoas/)** (HTML interface for HTTP)** - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.
            - Sample REST calls:
            - ```
GET /someresources/anId

PUT /someresources/anId
{"anotherdata": "another value"}
```
            - REST is focused on exposing data. It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs. REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, [representation through headers](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/headers.md), and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#disadvantages-rest)**Disadvantage(s): REST**>>>
                - With REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy. For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path. With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.
                - REST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case. For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.
        - **Security**>>>
            - This section could use some updates. Consider [contributing](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#contributing)!
            - Security is a broad topic. Unless you have considerable experience, a security background, or are applying for a position that requires knowledge of security, you probably won't need to know more than the basics:>>>
                - Encrypt in transit and at rest.
                - Sanitize all user inputs or any input parameters exposed to user to prevent [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) and [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).
                - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
                - Use the principle of [least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

            - Widely used hashing function that produces a 128-bit hash value
            - Uniformly distributed
        - Base 62>>>
            - Encodes to `[a-zA-Z0-9]` which works well for urls, eliminating the need for escaping special characters
            - Only one hash result for the original input and and the operation is deterministic (no randomness involved)
            - Base 64 is another popular encoding but provides issues for urls because of the additional `+` and `/` characters
        - What is HATEOAS?>>>
            - What is HATEOAS and why is it important for my REST API?
            - HATEOAS stands for **Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State**. It means that hypertext should be used to find your way through the API. An example:
            - ```
GET /account/12345 HTTP/1.1  HTTP/1.1 200 OK <?xml version="1.0"?> <account>     <account_number>12345</account_number>     <balance currency="usd">100.00</balance>     <link rel="deposit" href="/account/12345/deposit" />     <link rel="withdraw" href="/account/12345/withdraw" />     <link rel="transfer" href="/account/12345/transfer" />     <link rel="close" href="/account/12345/close" /> </account>
```
            - Apart from the fact that we have 100 dollars (US) in our account, we can see 4 options: deposit more money, withdraw money, transfer money to another account, or close our account. The "link"-tags allows us to find out the URLs that are needed for the specified actions. Now, let's suppose we didn't have 100 usd in the bank, but we actually are in the red:
            - ```
GET /account/12345 HTTP/1.1  HTTP/1.1 200 OK <?xml version="1.0"?> <account>     <account_number>12345</account_number>     <balance currency="usd">-25.00</balance>     <link rel="deposit" href="/account/12345/deposit" /> </account>
```
            - Now we are 25 dollars in the red. Do you see that right now we have lost many of our options, and only depositing money is valid? As long as we are in the red, we cannot close our account, nor transfer or withdraw any money from the account. The hypertext is actually telling us what is allowed and what not: HATEOAS

            - We could store info on the 10 million users in a [relational database](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#relational-database-management-system-rdbms). We should discuss the [use cases and tradeoffs between choosing SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sql-or-nosql).>>>
                - The **Client** sends a request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy-web-server)
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Accounts API** server
                - The **Accounts API** server updates the **SQL Database** `accounts` table with the newly entered account info
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - The `accounts` table could have the following structure:
            - ```
id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
created_at datetime NOT NULL
last_update datetime NOT NULL
account_url varchar(255) NOT NULL
account_login varchar(32) NOT NULL
account_password_hash char(64) NOT NULL
user_id int NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY(id)
FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
```
            - We'll create an [index](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#use-good-indices) on `id`, `user_id`, and `created_at` to speed up lookups (log-time instead of scanning the entire table) and to keep the data in memory. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)
            - We'll use a public [**REST API**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview##representational-state-transfer-rest):
            - ```
$ curl -X POST --data '{ "user_id": "foo", "account_url": "bar", \
    "account_login": "baz", "account_password": "qux" }' \
    https://mint.com/api/v1/account
```
            - For internal communications, we could use [Remote Procedure Calls](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#remote-procedure-call-rpc).
            - Next, the service extracts transactions from the account.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master/solutions/system_design/mint#use-case-service-extracts-transactions-from-the-account)**Use case: Service extracts transactions from the account**
            - We'll want to extract information from an account in these cases:>>>
                - The user first links the account
                - The user manually refreshes the account
                - Automatically each day for users who have been active in the past 30 days
            - Data flow:>>>
                - The **Client** sends a request to the **Web Server**
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Accounts API** server
                - The **Accounts API** server places a job on a **Queue** such as Amazon SQS or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)>>>
                    - Extracting transactions could take awhile, we'd probably want to do this [asynchronously with a queue](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#asynchronism), although this introduces additional complexity
                - The **Transaction Extraction Service** does the following:>>>
                    - Pulls from the **Queue** and extracts transactions for the given account from the financial institution, storing the results as raw log files in the **Object Store**
                    - Uses the **Category Service** to categorize each transaction
                    - Uses the **Budget Service** to calculate aggregate monthly spending by category>>>
                        - The **Budget Service** uses the **Notification Service** to let users know if they are nearing or have exceeded their budget
                    - Updates the **SQL Database** `transactions` table with categorized transactions
                    - Updates the **SQL Database** `monthly_spending` table with aggregate monthly spending by category
                    - Notifies the user the transactions have completed through the **Notification Service**:>>>
                        - Uses a **Queue** (not pictured) to asynchronously send out notifications
            - The `transactions` table could have the following structure:
            - ```
id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
created_at datetime NOT NULL
seller varchar(32) NOT NULL
amount decimal NOT NULL
user_id int NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY(id)

            - We'll create an [index](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#use-good-indices) on `id`, `user_id`, and `created_at`.
            - The `monthly_spending` table could have the following structure:

            - For the **Category Service**, we can seed a seller-to-category dictionary with the most popular sellers. If we estimate 50,000 sellers and estimate each entry to take less than 255 bytes, the dictionary would only take about 12 MB of memory.
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - ```
class DefaultCategories(Enum):

    HOUSING = 0
    FOOD = 1
    GAS = 2
    SHOPPING = 3
    ...

seller_category_map = {}
seller_category_map['Exxon'] = DefaultCategories.GAS
seller_category_map['Target'] = DefaultCategories.SHOPPING
...
```
            - For sellers not initially seeded in the map, we could use a crowdsourcing effort by evaluating the manual category overrides our users provide. We could use a heap to quickly lookup the top manual override per seller in O(1) time.
            - ```
class Categorizer(object):

    def __init__(self, seller_category_map, self.seller_category_crowd_overrides_map):

            - To start, we could use a generic budget template that allocates category amounts based on income tiers. Using this approach, we would not have to store the 100 million budget items identified in the constraints, only those that the user overrides. If a user overrides a budget category, which we could store the override in the `TABLE budget_overrides`.
            - ```
class Budget(object):

    def __init__(self, income):
        self.income = income
        self.categories_to_budget_map = self.create_budget_template()

    def create_budget_template(self):
        return {
            'DefaultCategories.HOUSING': income * .4,
            'DefaultCategories.FOOD': income * .2
            'DefaultCategories.GAS': income * .1,
            'DefaultCategories.SHOPPING': income * .2
            ...
        }

    def override_category_budget(self, category, amount):
        self.categories_to_budget_map[category] = amount
```
            - For the **Budget Service**, we can potentially run SQL queries on the `transactions` table to generate the `monthly_spending` aggregate table. The `monthly_spending` table would likely have much fewer rows than the total 5 billion transactions, since users typically have many transactions per month.
            - As an alternative, we can run **MapReduce** jobs on the raw transaction files to:>>>
                - Categorize each transaction
                - Generate aggregate monthly spending by category
            - Running analyses on the transaction files could significantly reduce the load on the database.
            - We could call the **Budget Service** to re-run the analysis if the user updates a category.
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - Sample log file format, tab delimited:
            - ```
user_id   timestamp   seller  amount

            - State you would 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat. See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/mint) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.
            - It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**? **CDN**?**Master-Slave Replicas**? What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?
            - We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.>>>

            - We'll add an additional use case: **User** accesses summaries and transactions.
            - User sessions, aggregate stats by category, and recent transactions could be placed in a **Memory Cache** such as Redis or Memcached.>>>
                - The **Client** sends a read request to the **Web Server**
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Read API** server>>>
                    - Static content can be served from the **Object Store** such as S3, which is cached on the **CDN**
                - The **Read API** server does the following:>>>
                    - Checks the **Memory Cache** for the content>>>
                        - If the url is in the **Memory Cache**, returns the cached contents

                                - Updates the **Memory Cache** with the contents
            - Refer to [When to update the cache](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#when-to-update-the-cache) for tradeoffs and alternatives. The approach above describes [cache-aside](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#cache-aside).
            - Instead of keeping the `monthly_spending` aggregate table in the **SQL Database**, we could create a separate **Analytics Database** using a data warehousing solution such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.
            - We might only want to store a month of `transactions` data in the database, while storing the rest in a data warehouse or in an **Object Store**. An **Object Store** such as Amazon S3 can comfortably handle the constraint of 250 GB of new content per month.
            - To address the 2,000  __average__  read requests per second (higher at peak), traffic for popular content should be handled by the **Memory Cache** instead of the database. The **Memory Cache** is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes. The **SQL Read Replicas** should be able to handle the cache misses, as long as the replicas are not bogged down with replicating writes.
            - 200  __average__  transaction writes per second (higher at peak) might be tough for a single **SQL Write Master-Slave**. We might need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns:>>>

            - We could use a [relational database](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#relational-database-management-system-rdbms) as a large hash table, mapping the generated url to a file server and path containing the paste file.
            - Instead of managing a file server, we could use a managed **Object Store** such as Amazon S3 or a [NoSQL document store](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#document-store).
            - An alternative to a relational database acting as a large hash table, we could use a [NoSQL key-value store](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#key-value-store). We should discuss the [tradeoffs between choosing SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sql-or-nosql). The following discussion uses the relational database approach.>>>
                - The **Client** sends a create paste request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy-web-server)
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Write API** server
                - The **Write API** server does does the following:>>>
                    - Generates a unique url>>>
                        - Checks if the url is unique by looking at the **SQL Database** for a duplicate
                        - If the url is not unique, it generates another url
                        - If we supported a custom url, we could use the user-supplied (also check for a duplicate)
                    - Saves to the **SQL Database** `pastes` table
                    - Saves the paste data to the **Object Store**
                    - Returns the url
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - The `pastes` table could have the following structure:
            - ```
shortlink char(7) NOT NULL
expiration_length_in_minutes int NOT NULL
created_at datetime NOT NULL
paste_path varchar(255) NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY(shortlink)
```
            - We'll create an [index](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#use-good-indices) on `shortlink` and `created_at` to speed up lookups (log-time instead of scanning the entire table) and to keep the data in memory. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)
            - To generate the unique url, we could:>>>
                - Take the [**MD5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash of the user's ip_address + timestamp>>>
                    - MD5 is a widely used hashing function that produces a 128-bit hash value
                    - MD5 is uniformly distributed
                    - Alternatively, we could also take the MD5 hash of randomly-generated data
                - [**Base 62**](https://www.kerstner.at/2012/07/shortening-strings-using-base-62-encoding/) encode the MD5 hash>>>
                    - Base 62 encodes to `[a-zA-Z0-9]` which works well for urls, eliminating the need for escaping special characters
                    - There is only one hash result for the original input and and Base 62 is deterministic (no randomness involved)
                    - Base 64 is another popular encoding but provides issues for urls because of the additional `+` and `/`characters
                    - The following [Base 62 pseudocode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/742013/how-to-code-a-url-shortener) runs in O(k) time where k is the number of digits = 7:
            - ```
def base_encode(num, base=62):
    digits = []
    while num > 0
      remainder = modulo(num, base)
      digits.push(remainder)
      num = divide(num, base)
    digits = digits.reverse
```>>>
                - Take the first 7 characters of the output, which results in 62^7 possible values and should be sufficient to handle our constraint of 360 million shortlinks in 3 years:
            - ```
url = base_encode(md5(ip_address+timestamp))[:URL_LENGTH]
```
            - We'll use a public [**REST API**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview##representational-state-transfer-rest):
            - ```
$ curl -X POST --data '{ "expiration_length_in_minutes": "60", \
    "paste_contents": "Hello World!" }' https://pastebin.com/api/v1/paste
```
            - Response:
            - ```
{
    "shortlink": "foobar"
}
```
            - For internal communications, we could use [Remote Procedure Calls](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#remote-procedure-call-rpc).

                - The **Client** sends a get paste request to the **Web Server**
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Read API** server
                - The **Read API** server does the following:>>>
                    - Checks the **SQL Database** for the generated url>>>
                        - If the url is in the **SQL Database**, fetch the paste contents from the **Object Store**
                        - Else, return an error message for the user
            - REST API:
            - ```
$ curl https://pastebin.com/api/v1/paste?shortlink=foobar
```
            - Response:
            - ```
{
    "paste_contents": "Hello World"
    "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
    "expiration_length_in_minutes": "60"

            - Since realtime analytics are not a requirement, we could simply **MapReduce** the **Web Server** logs to generate hit counts.
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - ```
class HitCounts(MRJob):

            - To delete expired pastes, we could just scan the **SQL Database** for all entries whose expiration timestamp are older than the current timestamp. All expired entries would then be deleted (or marked as expired) from the table.

            - **Important: Do not simply jump right into the final design from the initial design!**
            - State you would do this iteratively: 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat. See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/pastebin) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.
            - It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**? **CDN**?**Master-Slave Replicas**? What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?
            - We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.>>>

                    - [Availability patterns](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#availability-patterns)
            - The **Analytics Database** could use a data warehousing solution such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.
            - An **Object Store** such as Amazon S3 can comfortably handle the constraint of 12.7 GB of new content per month.
            - To address the 40  __average__  read requests per second (higher at peak), traffic for popular content should be handled by the **Memory Cache** instead of the database. The **Memory Cache** is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes. The **SQL Read Replicas** should be able to handle the cache misses, as long as the replicas are not bogged down with replicating writes.
            - 4  __average__  paste writes per second (with higher at peak) should be do-able for a single **SQL Write Master-Slave**. Otherwise, we'll need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns:>>>

            - We could store the raw **Sales API** server log files on a managed **Object Store** such as Amazon S3, rather than managing our own distributed file system.
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - We'll assume this is a sample log entry, tab delimited:
            - ```
timestamp   product_id  category_id    qty     total_price   seller_id    buyer_id
t1          product1    category1      2       20.00         1            1
t2          product1    category2      2       20.00         2            2

```
            - The **Sales Rank Service** could use **MapReduce**, using the **Sales API** server log files as input and writing the results to an aggregate table `sales_rank` in a **SQL Database**. We should discuss the [use cases and tradeoffs between choosing SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sql-or-nosql).
            - We'll use a multi-step **MapReduce**:>>>
                - **Step 1** - Transform the data to `(category, product_id), sum(quantity)`
                - **Step 2** - Perform a distributed sort
            - ```
class SalesRanker(MRJob):

    def within_past_week(self, timestamp):
        """Return True if timestamp is within past week, False otherwise."""
        ...

    def mapper(self, _ line):
        """Parse each log line, extract and transform relevant lines.

        Emit key value pairs of the form:

        (category1, product1), 2
        (category2, product1), 2
        (category2, product1), 1
        (category1, product2), 3
        (category2, product3), 7
        (category1, product4), 1
        """
        timestamp, product_id, category_id, quantity, total_price, seller_id, \
            buyer_id = line.split('\t')
        if self.within_past_week(timestamp):
            yield (category_id, product_id), quantity

    def reducer(self, key, value):
        """Sum values for each key.

        (category1, product1), 2
        (category2, product1), 3

        (category1, product4), 1
        """
        yield key, sum(values)

    def mapper_sort(self, key, value):
        """Construct key to ensure proper sorting.

        Transform key and value to the form:

        (category1, 3), product2
        (category2, 7), product3
        (category1, 1), product4

        The shuffle/sort step of MapReduce will then do a
        distributed sort on the keys, resulting in:

        (category1, 1), product4
        (category1, 2), product1
        (category1, 3), product2
        (category2, 3), product1
        (category2, 7), product3
        """
        category_id, product_id = key
        quantity = value
        yield (category_id, quantity), product_id

    def reducer_identity(self, key, value):
        yield key, value

    def steps(self):
        """Run the map and reduce steps."""
        return [
            self.mr(mapper=self.mapper,
                    reducer=self.reducer),
            self.mr(mapper=self.mapper_sort,
                    reducer=self.reducer_identity),
        ]
```
            - The result would be the following sorted list, which we could insert into the `sales_rank` table:
            - ```
(category1, 1), product4
(category1, 2), product1
(category1, 3), product2
(category2, 3), product1
(category2, 7), product3
```
            - The `sales_rank` table could have the following structure:
            - ```
id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
category_id int NOT NULL
total_sold int NOT NULL
product_id int NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY(id)
FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES Categories(id)
FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES Products(id)
```
            - We'll create an [index](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#use-good-indices) on `id`, `category_id`, and `product_id` to speed up lookups (log-time instead of scanning the entire table) and to keep the data in memory. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)

                - The **Client** sends a request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy-web-server)
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Read API** server
                - The **Read API** server reads from the **SQL Database** `sales_rank` table
            - We'll use a public [**REST API**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview##representational-state-transfer-rest):
            - ```

            - Response:
            - ```

            - **Important: Do not simply jump right into the final design from the initial design!**
            - State you would 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat. See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/sales_rank) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.
            - It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**? **CDN**?**Master-Slave Replicas**? What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?
            - We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.>>>
                -  __To avoid repeating discussions__ , refer to the following [system design topics](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#) for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:>>>

                    - [Availability patterns](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#availability-patterns)
            - The **Analytics Database** could use a data warehousing solution such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.
            - We might only want to store a limited time period of data in the database, while storing the rest in a data warehouse or in an **Object Store**. An **Object Store** such as Amazon S3 can comfortably handle the constraint of 40 GB of new content per month.
            - To address the 40,000  __average__  read requests per second (higher at peak), traffic for popular content (and their sales rank) should be handled by the **Memory Cache** instead of the database. The **Memory Cache** is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes. With the large volume of reads, the **SQL Read Replicas** might not be able to handle the cache misses. We'll probably need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns.
            - 400  __average__  writes per second (higher at peak) might be tough for a single **SQL Write Master-Slave**, also pointing to a need for additional scaling techniques.
            - SQL scaling patterns include:>>>

            - We'll assume we have an initial list of `links_to_crawl` ranked initially based on overall site popularity. If this is not a reasonable assumption, we can seed the crawler with popular sites that link to outside content such as [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/), [DMOZ](http://www.dmoz.org/), etc
            - We'll use a table `crawled_links` to store processed links and their page signatures.
            - We could store `links_to_crawl` and `crawled_links` in a key-value **NoSQL Database**. For the ranked links in `links_to_crawl`, we could use [Redis](https://redis.io/) with sorted sets to maintain a ranking of page links. We should discuss the [use cases and tradeoffs between choosing SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sql-or-nosql).>>>
                - The **Crawler Service** processes each page link by doing the following in a loop:>>>
                    - Takes the top ranked page link to crawl>>>
                        - Checks `crawled_links` in the **NoSQL Database** for an entry with a similar page signature>>>
                            - If we have a similar page, reduces the priority of the page link>>>
                                - This prevents us from getting into a cycle
                                - Continue
                            - Else, crawls the link>>>
                                - Adds a job to the **Reverse Index Service** queue to generate a [reverse index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_indexing)
                                - Adds a job to the **Document Service** queue to generate a static title and snippet
                                - Generates the page signature
                                - Removes the link from `links_to_crawl` in the **NoSQL Database**
                                - Inserts the page link and signature to `crawled_links` in the **NoSQL Database**
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - `PagesDataStore` is an abstraction within the **Crawler Service** that uses the **NoSQL Database**:
            - ```
class PagesDataStore(object):

    def __init__(self, db);
        self.db = db
        ...

    def add_link_to_crawl(self, url):

        ...

    def crawled_similar(self, signature):
        """Determine if we've already crawled a page matching the given signature"""
        ...
```
            - `Page` is an abstraction within the **Crawler Service** that encapsulates a page, its contents, child urls, and signature:
            - ```
class Page(object):

    def __init__(self, url, contents, child_urls, signature):
        self.url = url
        self.contents = contents
        self.child_urls = child_urls
        self.signature = signature
```
            - `Crawler` is the main class within **Crawler Service**, composed of `Page` and `PagesDataStore`.
            - ```
class Crawler(object):

    def __init__(self, data_store, reverse_index_queue, doc_index_queue):
        self.data_store = data_store

                self.crawl_page(page)
```

            - We need to be careful the web crawler doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop, which happens when the graph contains a cycle.
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - We'll want to remove duplicate urls:>>>
                - For smaller lists we could use something like `sort | unique`
                - With 1 billion links to crawl, we could use **MapReduce** to output only entries that have a frequency of 1
            - ```
class RemoveDuplicateUrls(MRJob):

    def mapper(self, _, line):
        yield line, 1

    def reducer(self, key, values):
        total = sum(values)
        if total == 1:
            yield key, total
```
            - Detecting duplicate content is more complex. We could generate a signature based on the contents of the page and compare those two signatures for similarity. Some potential algorithms are [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) and [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).

            - Pages need to be crawled regularly to ensure freshness. Crawl results could have a `timestamp` field that indicates the last time a page was crawled. After a default time period, say one week, all pages should be refreshed. Frequently updated or more popular sites could be refreshed in shorter intervals.
            - Although we won't dive into details on analytics, we could do some data mining to determine the mean time before a particular page is updated, and use that statistic to determine how often to re-crawl the page.
            - We might also choose to support a `Robots.txt` file that gives webmasters control of crawl frequency.

                - The **Client** sends a request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy-web-server)
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Query API** server
                - The **Query API** server does does the following:>>>
                    - Parses the query>>>
                        - Removes markup
                        - Breaks up the text into terms
                        - Fixes typos
                        - Normalizes capitalization
                        - Converts the query to use boolean operations
                    - Uses the **Reverse Index Service** to find documents matching the query>>>
                        - The **Reverse Index Service** ranks the matching results and returns the top ones
                    - Uses the **Document Service** to return titles and snippets
            - We'll use a public [**REST API**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview##representational-state-transfer-rest):
            - ```
$ curl https://search.com/api/v1/search?query=hello+world
```
            - Response:
            - ```
{
    "title": "foo's title",
    "snippet": "foo's snippet",
    "link": "https://foo.com",

            - **Important: Do not simply jump right into the final design from the initial design!**
            - State you would 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat. See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/web_crawler) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.
            - It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**? **CDN**?**Master-Slave Replicas**? What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?
            - We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.>>>
                -  __To avoid repeating discussions__ , refer to the following [system design topics](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#) for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:>>>

                    - [Availability patterns](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#availability-patterns)
            - Some searches are very popular, while others are only executed once. Popular queries can be served from a **Memory Cache** such as Redis or Memcached to reduce response times and to avoid overloading the **Reverse Index Service** and **Document Service**. The **Memory Cache** is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)
            - Below are a few other optimizations to the **Crawling Service**:>>>
                - To handle the data size and request load, the **Reverse Index Service** and **Document Service** will likely need to make heavy use sharding and replication.
                - DNS lookup can be a bottleneck, the **Crawler Service** can keep its own DNS lookup that is refreshed periodically
                - The **Crawler Service** can improve performance and reduce memory usage by keeping many open connections at a time, referred to as [connection pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool)>>>
                    - Switching to [UDP](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#user-datagram-protocol-udp) could also boost performance
                - Web crawling is bandwidth intensive, ensure there is enough bandwidth to sustain high throughput

            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - Without the constraint of millions of users (vertices) and billions of friend relationships (edges), we could solve this unweighted shortest path task with a general BFS approach:
            - ```
class Graph(Graph):

    def shortest_path(self, source, dest):
        if source is None or dest is None:
            return None

        return None
```
            - We won't be able to fit all users on the same machine, we'll need to [shard](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sharding) users across **Person Servers** and access them with a **Lookup Service**.>>>
                - The **Client** sends a request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy-web-server)
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Search API** server
                - The **Search API** server forwards the request to the **User Graph Service**
                - The **User Graph Service** does does the following:>>>
                    - Uses the **Lookup Service** to find the **Person Server** where the current user's info is stored
                    - Finds the appropriate **Person Server** to retrieve the current user's list of `friend_ids`
                    - Runs a BFS search using the current user as the `source` and the current user's `friend_ids` as the ids for each `adjacent_node`
                    - To get the `adjacent_node` from a given id:>>>
                        - The **User Graph Service** will  __again__  need to communicate with the **Lookup Service** to determine which **Person Server** stores the`adjacent_node` matching the given id (potential for optimization)
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you should be writing**.

            - State you would 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat. See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/social_graph) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.
            - It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**? **CDN**?**Master-Slave Replicas**? What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?
            - We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.>>>
                -  __To avoid repeating discussions__ , refer to the following [system design topics](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#) for main talking points, tradeoffs, and alternatives:>>>

                    - [Availability patterns](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#availability-patterns)
            - To address the constraint of 400  __average__  read requests per second (higher at peak), person data can be served from a **Memory Cache** such as Redis or Memcached to reduce response times and to reduce traffic to downstream services. This could be especially useful for people who do multiple searches in succession and for people who are well-connected. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)
            - Below are further optimizations:>>>
                - Store complete or partial BFS traversals to speed up subsequent lookups in the **Memory Cache**
                - Batch compute offline then store complete or partial BFS traversals to speed up subsequent lookups in a **NoSQL Database**
                - Reduce machine jumps by batching together friend lookups hosted on the same **Person Server**>>>
                    - [Shard](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#Sharding) **Person Servers** by location to further improve this, as friends generally live closer to each other
                - Do two BFS searches at the same time, one starting from the source, and one from the destination, then merge the two paths
                - Start the BFS search from people with large numbers of friends, as they are more likely to reduce the number of [degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) between the current user and the search target
                - Set a limit based on time or number of hops before asking the user if they want to continue searching, as searching could take a considerable amount of time in some cases
                - Use a **Graph Database** such as [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) or a graph-specific query language such as [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) (if there were no constraint preventing the use of **Graph Databases**)

                - Posting a tweet should be fast>>>
                    - Fanning out a tweet to all of your followers should be fast, unless you have millions of followers
                - 100 million active users
                - 500 million tweets per day or 15 billion tweets per month>>>
                    - Each tweet averages a fanout of 10 deliveries

                    - `user_id` - 32 bytes
                    - `text` - 140 bytes

            - We could store the user's own tweets to populate the user timeline (activity from the user) in a [relational database](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#relational-database-management-system-rdbms). We should discuss the [use cases and tradeoffs between choosing SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sql-or-nosql).
            - Delivering tweets and building the home timeline (activity from people the user is following) is trickier. Fanning out tweets to all followers (60 thousand tweets delivered on fanout per second) will overload a traditional [relational database](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#relational-database-management-system-rdbms). We'll probably want to choose a data store with fast writes such as a **NoSQL database** or **Memory Cache**. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)
            - We could store media such as photos or videos on an **Object Store**.>>>
                - The **Client** posts a tweet to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy-web-server)
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Write API** server
                - The **Write API** stores the tweet in the user's timeline on a **SQL database**
                - The **Write API** contacts the **Fan Out Service**, which does the following:>>>
                    - Queries the **User Graph Service** to find the user's followers stored in the **Memory Cache**
                    - Stores the tweet in the  __home timeline of the user's followers__  in a **Memory Cache**>>>
                        - O(n) operation: 1,000 followers = 1,000 lookups and inserts
                    - Stores the tweet in the **Search Index Service** to enable fast searching
                    - Stores media in the **Object Store**
                    - Uses the **Notification Service** to send out push notifications to followers:>>>
                        - Uses a **Queue** (not pictured) to asynchronously send out notifications
            - **Clarify with your interviewer how much code you are expected to write**.
            - If our **Memory Cache** is Redis, we could use a native Redis list with the following structure:
            - ```
tweet n+2                   tweet n+1                   tweet n
| 8 bytes   8 bytes  1 byte | 8 bytes   8 bytes  1 byte | 8 bytes   7 bytes  1 byte |
| tweet_id  user_id  meta   | tweet_id  user_id  meta   | tweet_id  user_id  meta   |
```
            - The new tweet would be placed in the **Memory Cache**, which populates user's home timeline (activity from people the user is following).
            - We'll use a public [**REST API**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview##representational-state-transfer-rest):
            - ```
$ curl -X POST --data '{ "user_id": "123", "auth_token": "ABC123", \
    "status": "hello world!", "media_ids": "ABC987" }' \
    https://twitter.com/api/v1/tweet
```
            - Response:
            - ```
{
    "created_at": "Wed Sep 05 00:37:15 +0000 2012",
    "status": "hello world!",
    "tweet_id": "987",
    "user_id": "123",
    ...
}
```
            - For internal communications, we could use [Remote Procedure Calls](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#remote-procedure-call-rpc).

                - The **Client** posts a home timeline request to the **Web Server**
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Read API** server
                - The **Read API** server contacts the **Timeline Service**, which does the following:>>>
                    - Gets the timeline data stored in the **Memory Cache**, containing tweet ids and user ids - O(1)
                    - Queries the **Tweet Info Service** with a [multiget](http://redis.io/commands/mget) to obtain additional info about the tweet ids - O(n)
                    - Queries the **User Info Service** with a multiget to obtain additional info about the user ids - O(n)
            - REST API:
            - ```
$ curl https://twitter.com/api/v1/home_timeline?user_id=123
```
            - Response:
            - ```
{
    "user_id": "456",

                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Read API** server
                - The **Read API** retrieves the user timeline from the **SQL Database**
            - The REST API would be similar to the home timeline, except all tweets would come from the user as opposed to the people the user is following.

                - The **Client** sends a search request to the **Web Server**
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Search API** server
                - The **Search API** contacts the **Search Service**, which does the following:>>>
                    - Parses/tokenizes the input query, determining what needs to be searched>>>
                        - Removes markup
                        - Breaks up the text into terms
                        - Fixes typos
                        - Normalizes capitalization
                        - Converts the query to use boolean operations
                    - Queries the **Search Cluster** (ie [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/)) for the results:>>>
                        - [Scatter gathers](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#scatter-gather) each server in the cluster to determine if there are any results for the query
                        - Merges, ranks, sorts, and returns the results
            - REST API:
            - ```
$ curl https://twitter.com/api/v1/search?query=hello+world
```
            - The response would be similar to that of the home timeline, except for tweets matching the given query.

            - State you would 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat. See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/twitter) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.
            - It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**? **CDN**?**Master-Slave Replicas**? What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?
            - We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.>>>

            - The **Fanout Service** is a potential bottleneck. Twitter users with millions of followers could take several minutes to have their tweets go through the fanout process. This could lead to race conditions with @replies to the tweet, which we could mitigate by re-ordering the tweets at serve time.
            - We could also avoid fanning out tweets from highly-followed users. Instead, we could search to find tweets for high-followed users, merge the search results with the user's home timeline results, then re-order the tweets at serve time.
            - Additional optimizations include:>>>
                - Keep only several hundred tweets for each home timeline in the **Memory Cache**
                - Keep only active users' home timeline info in the **Memory Cache**>>>
                    - If a user was not previously active in the past 30 days, we could rebuild the timeline from the **SQL Database**>>>
                        - Query the **User Graph Service** to determine who the user is following
                        - Get the tweets from the **SQL Database** and add them to the **Memory Cache**
                - Store only a month of tweets in the **Tweet Info Service**
                - Store only active users in the **User Info Service**
                - The **Search Cluster** would likely need to keep the tweets in memory to keep latency low
            - We'll also want to address the bottleneck with the **SQL Database**.
            - Although the **Memory Cache** should reduce the load on the database, it is unlikely the **SQL Read Replicas** alone would be enough to handle the cache misses. We'll probably need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns.
            - The high volume of writes would overwhelm a single **SQL Write Master-Slave**, also pointing to a need for additional scaling techniques.>>>

            - Popular queries can be served from a **Memory Cache** such as Redis or Memcached to reduce read latency and to avoid overloading the **Reverse Index Service** and **Document Service**. Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)
            - Since the cache has limited capacity, we'll use a least recently used (LRU) approach to expire older entries.>>>
                - The **Client** sends a request to the **Web Server**, running as a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy-web-server)
                - The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Query API** server
                - The **Query API** server does the following:>>>
                    - Parses the query>>>
                        - Removes markup

                        - Normalizes capitalization
                        - Converts the query to use boolean operations
                    - Checks the **Memory Cache** for the content matching the query>>>
                        - If there's a hit in the **Memory Cache**, the **Memory Cache** does the following:>>>
                            - Updates the cached entry's position to the front of the LRU list
                            - Returns the cached contents
                        - Else, the **Query API** does the following:>>>
                            - Uses the **Reverse Index Service** to find documents matching the query>>>
                                - The **Reverse Index Service** ranks the matching results and returns the top ones
                            - Uses the **Document Service** to return titles and snippets
                            - Updates the **Memory Cache** with the contents, placing the entry at the front of the LRU list

            - The cache should be updated when:>>>
                - The page contents change
                - The page is removed or a new page is added
                - The page rank changes
            - The most straightforward way to handle these cases is to simply set a max time that a cached entry can stay in the cache before it is updated, usually referred to as time to live (TTL).

            - **Important: Do not simply jump right into the final design from the initial design!**
            - State you would 1) **Benchmark/Load Test**, 2) **Profile** for bottlenecks 3) address bottlenecks while evaluating alternatives and trade-offs, and 4) repeat. See [Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/query_cache) as a sample on how to iteratively scale the initial design.
            - It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter with the initial design and how you might address each of them. For example, what issues are addressed by adding a **Load Balancer** with multiple **Web Servers**? **CDN**?**Master-Slave Replicas**? What are the alternatives and **Trade-Offs** for each?
            - We'll introduce some components to complete the design and to address scalability issues. Internal load balancers are not shown to reduce clutter.>>>

            - To handle the heavy request load and the large amount of memory needed, we'll scale horizontally. We have three main options on how to store the data on our **Memory Cache** cluster:>>>
                - **Each machine in the cache cluster has its own cache** - Simple, although it will likely result in a low cache hit rate.
                - **Each machine in the cache cluster has a copy of the cache** - Simple, although it is an inefficient use of memory.
                - **The cache is **[**sharded**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sharding)** across all machines in the cache cluster** - More complex, although it is likely the best option. We could use hashing to determine which machine could have the cached results of a query using `machine = hash(query)`. We'll likely want to use [consistent hashing](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#consistent-hashing).

            - We've been able to address these issues with **Vertical Scaling** so far. Unfortunately, this has become quite expensive and it doesn't allow for independent scaling of the **MySQL Database** and **Web Server**.

                    - Create a public subnet for the single **Web Server** so it can send and receive traffic from the internet
                    - Create a private subnet for everything else, preventing outside access
                    - Only open ports from whitelisted IPs for each component
                - These same patterns should be implemented for new components in the remainder of the exercise

                - The following goals attempt to address the scaling issues with the **Web Server**>>>
                    - Based on the **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling**, you might only need to implement one or two of these techniques
                - Use [**Horizontal Scaling**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#horizontal-scaling) to handle increasing loads and to address single points of failure>>>
                    - Add a [**Load Balancer**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#load-balancer) such as Amazon's ELB or HAProxy>>>
                        - ELB is highly available
                        - If you are configuring your own **Load Balancer**, setting up multiple servers in [active-active](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#active-active) or [active-passive](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#active-passive) in multiple availability zones will improve availability
                        - Terminate SSL on the **Load Balancer** to reduce computational load on backend servers and to simplify certificate administration
                    - Use multiple **Web Servers** spread out over multiple availability zones
                    - Use multiple **MySQL** instances in [**Master-Slave Failover**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#master-slave-replication) mode across multiple availability zones to improve redundancy
                - Separate out the **Web Servers** from the [**Application Servers**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#application-layer)>>>
                    - Scale and configure both layers independently
                    - **Web Servers** can run as a [**Reverse Proxy**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#reverse-proxy)
                    - For example, you can add **Application Servers** handling **Read APIs** while others handle **Write APIs**
                - Move static (and some dynamic) content to a [**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#content-delivery-network) such as CloudFront to reduce load and latency

                    - Based on the **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling**, you might only need to implement one or two of these techniques
                - Move the following data to a [**Memory Cache**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#cache) such as Elasticache to reduce load and latency:>>>
                    - Frequently accessed content from **MySQL**>>>
                        - First, try to configure the **MySQL Database** cache to see if that is sufficient to relieve the bottleneck before implementing a **Memory Cache**
                    - Session data from the **Web Servers**>>>
                        - The **Web Servers** become stateless, allowing for **Autoscaling**
                    - Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.[1](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)
                - Add [**MySQL Read Replicas**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#master-slave-replication) to reduce load on the write master
                - Add more **Web Servers** and **Application Servers** to improve responsiveness

                - Add logic to **Web Server** to separate out writes and reads
                - Add **Load Balancers** in front of **MySQL Read Replicas** (not pictured to reduce clutter)

            - Our **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling** show that our traffic spikes during regular business hours in the U.S. and drop significantly when users leave the office. We think we can cut costs by automatically spinning up and down servers based on actual load. We're a small shop so we'd like to automate as much of the DevOps as possible for **Autoscaling** and for the general operations.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master/solutions/system_design/scaling_aws#goals-4)**Goals**>>>
                - Add **Autoscaling** to provision capacity as needed>>>
                    - Keep up with traffic spikes
                    - Reduce costs by powering down unused instances
                - Automate DevOps>>>
                    - Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc
                - Continue monitoring metrics to address bottlenecks>>>
                    - **Host level** - Review a single EC2 instance
                    - **Aggregate level** - Review load balancer stats
                    - **Log analysis** - CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Loggly, Splunk, Sumo
                    - **External site performance** - Pingdom or New Relic
                    - **Handle notifications and incidents** - PagerDuty
                    - **Error Reporting** - Sentry

                - Consider a managed service such as AWS **Autoscaling**>>>
                    - Create one group for each **Web Server** and one for each **Application Server** type, place each group in multiple availability zones
                    - Set a min and max number of instances
                    - Trigger to scale up and down through CloudWatch>>>
                        - Simple time of day metric for predictable loads or
                        - Metrics over a time period:>>>
                            - CPU load
                            - Latency
                            - Network traffic
                            - Custom metric
                    - Disadvantages>>>
                        - Autoscaling can introduce complexity
                        - It could take some time before a system appropriately scales up to meet increased demand, or to scale down when demand drops

            - As the service continues to grow towards the figures outlined in the constraints, we iteratively run **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling** to uncover and address new bottlenecks.
            - [**Link**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master/solutions/system_design/scaling_aws#goals-5)**Goals**
            - We'll continue to address scaling issues due to the problem's constraints:>>>
                - If our **MySQL Database** starts to grow too large, we might considering only storing a limited time period of data in the database, while storing the rest in a data warehouse such as Redshift>>>
                    - A data warehouse such as Redshift can comfortably handle the constraint of 1 TB of new content per month
                - With 40,000 average read requests per second, read traffic for popular content can be addressed by scaling the **Memory Cache**, which is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes>>>
                    - The **SQL Read Replicas** might have trouble handling the cache misses, we'll probably need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns
                - 400 average writes per second (with presumably significantly higher peaks) might be tough for a single **SQL Write Master-Slave**, also pointing to a need for additional scaling techniques
            - SQL scaling patterns include:>>>
                - [Federation](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#federation)
                - [Sharding](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sharding)
                - [Denormalization](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#denormalization)
                - [SQL Tuning](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#sql-tuning)
            - To further address the high read and write requests, we should also consider moving appropriate data to a [**NoSQL Database**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#nosql) such as DynamoDB.
            - We can further separate out our [**Application Servers**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#application-layer) to allow for independent scaling. Batch processes or computations that do not need to be done in real-time can be done [**Asynchronously**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer-interview#asynchronism) with **Queues** and **Workers**:>>>
                - For example, in a photo service, the photo upload and the thumbnail creation can be separated:>>>
                    - **Client** uploads photo
                    - **Application Server** puts a job in a **Queue** such as SQS
                    - The **Worker Service** on EC2 or Lambda pulls work off the **Queue** then:>>>
                        - Creates a thumbnail
                        - Updates a **Database**
                        - Stores the thumbnail in the **Object Store**
