- Simple Interest

  $$I = Prt\\F = P + I$$

  
- Compound Interest
- simplified equation (for easy memorization)
    - 

      $$F = P(1+i)^n$$

       
- expanded equation
    - 

      $$F = P(1+\frac{j}{m})^{tm}$$

      
    - where:
        - P is the **principal** 
        - j is the **rate per year** 
        - t is **time in years** 
        - m is the **number of times the interest is compounded per year**

- Annuity
    - An annuity is a sequence of equal payments
made at equal intervals.
    - The amount of each payment is referred to as
the regular payment, denoted by R
    - 

      $$F = R(\frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i})$$

      
        - this formula was derived from the [Sum of a Geometric Sequence](../../General Math/Infinite Geometric Sequence/Sum of a Geometric Sequence.md) equation
    - the Present value can be derived from the future value F by discounting F n times
    - 

      $$P = R(\frac{1-(1+i)^{-n}}{i})$$
