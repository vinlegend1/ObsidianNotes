- Steels are one of the most widely used engineering materials>>>
    - alloy of carbon and iron
    - low carbon
    - medium carbon
    - high carbon
    - cast iron
- What causes the change in mechanical properties?
    - a phase is a region of a material w/ uniform chemical and physical properties
- Metal Alloys>>>
    - ferrous>>>
        - steels>>>
            - 0.04-1.7 wt% carbon
            - low alloy>>>
                - low 0.04-0.3 wt% carbon
                - med 0.3-0.7 wt% carbon
                - high 0.7-1.7 wt% carbon
                - iron alloy where carbon is the main alloy
            - high alloy>>>
                - tool
                - stainless
        - cast irons→brittle 1.7-4.0% carbon
    - non-ferrous
    - 
- Different phases of iron (Fe)
    - 3 different forms of iron depending on temperature
        - Ferrite ($\alpha -Fe$)↔BCC crystal structure, exists at < 910 deg C Magnetic 
        - Austenite ($\gamma - Fe$)↔FCC crystal structure, $910^\circ C < T < 1391^\circ C$ Non-magnetic
        - $\delta -Fe$↔BCC crystal structure, $1391^\circ C < T < 1536^\circ C$
    - Fe-C alloys
        - $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are used to describe interstitial solid solutions of carbon in iron but are now not pure forms of iron
    - eutectic point>>>
        - corresponds to lowest melting
        - hypo-eutectic
        - hyper-eutectice
    - eutectoid point>>>
        - a point where a solid phase is in equilibrium w/ 2 other solid phases
    - cementite
    - pearline↔layers of ferrite and cementite
- Metal Alloys, Phase Diagram, lever rule
    - periodic table gives us our basic metal building blocks
    - alloying a material w/ another allows us to {{change its properties}} 
    - Bronze↔an alloy of copper and tin
        - hard and resists corrosion↔perfect for statues
    - Brass is an alloy of Cu and Zn
        - softer and malleable↔musical instruments
    - Alloy>>>
        - binary
        - tertiary
    - Component←an element included in an alloy
    - Phase>>>
        - a region of material having uniform physical and chemical properties
        - what phase diagram
- Ashby plots and performance indices
    - Ashby plot>>>
        - create a performance index
        - from fundamental equations / simplifications
        - create minimum baseline
    - example of Ashby plot>>>
        - Young's Modulus vs. density plot
    - consider factors like>>>
        - weight
        - stiffness
        - strength
        - cost
        - ease of manufacture
    - performance index unlikely to factor everything but {{good "filter"}} 
        - cost should be relative cost instead of absolute cost→so less volatility
- Strengthening Material>>>
    - solid solution hard>>>
        - high impurity metals are almost always softer than ‒-
        - increasing impurities increases their tensile and yield shield
        - impurities cause lattice strains which impede dislocations
        - dislocation is a linear defect in a crystalline material
        - dislocation behavior affects mechanical properties
    - strain hardening
    - precipitation hardening
    - smaller substitution→tensile lattice strain
    - larger substitution→compressive lattice strain
- Grain size
    - influence mechanical properties
    - mobility of dislocation
    - fine grain material stronger, harder
        - anneal at lower temperatures for finer grain
            - 

              $$\sigma_y = \sigma_i + \frac{k}{\sqrt{d}}$$

              
    - strain hardening
        - metal becomes harder / stronger as it is plastically deformed
    - precipitation hardening
