- Second Law:
    - Puts restrictions on useful conversion of q to w
    - Follows from observation of a directionality to natural or spontaneous processes
    - Provides a set of principles for - determining the direction of spontaneous change - determining equilibrium state of system  
    - helps dictate directionality of natural processes
    - restricts energy conservation of a natural process and introduces irreversibility
    - Kevin-Plank Statement
        - > It is impossible for a device to operate and produce a net amount of work if it only receives heat from a single thermal reservoir

- Heat reservoir>>>
    - A very large system of uniform T, which does not change regardless of the amount of heat added or withdrawn. Also called heat bath. Real systems can come close to this idealization.   
- All spontaneous processes are irreversible.

- it takes an infinite amount of work to extract heat from a reservoir at 0 K
