- Redbubble Preparation
- The first thing you need to do is register to the [Redbubble](https://medium.com/geekculture/www.redbubble.com) and note your username and password. Then you need to upload one of your designs as a base for our automatic uploader.
- Take note of the following things for your design before uploading it:
    1. Design dimension
    2. Available Product
    3. Design position on product
- Because we would have the same base for all the future designs, we would upload so, make sure all designs were perfect. Of course, you could set up several base designs if you have specific requirements for each design.
