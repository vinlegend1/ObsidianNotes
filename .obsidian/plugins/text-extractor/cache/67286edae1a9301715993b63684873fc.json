{"path":"Pastes/20241024 115323.png","text":"From figure 6.43, we can see that a Zener diode is like an ordinary silicon diode when operated in the forward bias region. It will startto conduet current when the voltage across it is approximately 0.7 V. In the reverse bias region, the Zener diode assumes an open-circuit state or “off\" state wntil the reverse voltage actoss it is equal to the Zener breakdown voltage, Vz. When the Zener diode is operating in the Zener region, it s said to be in ifs “on” state wherein the voltage across it remains almost constant equal to Vz over a wide range of Zener current. Irg is the mininmum value of the reverse cument that must be maintained in order to keep the diode in the breakdown region for voltage regulation. Iy s the maximum value of the reverse current that may pass through the Zener diode.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
