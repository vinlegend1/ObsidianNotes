## Lecture Summary

## Equations Charts and Tables
$$u = \frac{\pi D n}{60}$$

## Key Concepts 
- **Use Affinity Laws with Caution**
	- Geometric similarity
	- rotational speed must not be too large
	- there might be cavitation when rotational speed it too high
- cavitation is caused by a lowered pressure state compared to vapor pressure causing the liquid to boil and create bubbles
- pressure at the throat or suction must be >= vapor pressure
- large machines are more efficient than smaller ones because flow passages are larger
- Equations for Ideal power and head for pumps are derived based on impeller velocity and diameter
## Questions
- Where did the Torque equation come from? It looks similar to the momentum equation.
- What is alpha1 and alpha2?
